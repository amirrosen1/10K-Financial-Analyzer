(1) In May 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company’s share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion
of the Company’s common stock, of which $166 billion had been utilized as of September 30, 2017. The remaining $44 billion in the table
represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of September 30, 2017. The
Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be
repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the
Exchange Act.
(2) In May 2017, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) to purchase up to $3.0 billion of the
Company’s common stock. In August 2017, the purchase period for this ASR ended and an additional 4.5 million shares were delivered
and retired. In total, 20.1 million shares were delivered under this ASR at an average repurchase price of $149.20.
(3) In August 2017, the Company entered into a new ASR to purchase up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In exchange for an
up-front payment of $3.0 billion, the financial institution party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the Company during the
ASR’s purchase period, which will end in November 2017. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price
paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume-weighted average price of the
Company’s common stock during that period.
