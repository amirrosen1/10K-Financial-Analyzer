Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years
2018 and 2016 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first quarter
of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.
Fiscal 2018 Highlights
Net sales increased 16% or $36.4 billion during 2018 compared to 2017, driven by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Other
Products. Net sales increased year-over-year in each of the geographic reportable segments.
In May 2018, the Company announced a new capital return program of $100 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.63 to
$0.73 per share beginning in May 2018. During 2018, the Company spent $73.1 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock
and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $13.7 billion.
Fiscal 2017 Highlights
Net sales increased 6% or $13.6 billion during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac. The
year-over-year increase in net sales reflected growth in each of the geographic reportable segments, with the exception of Greater
China. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2017.
In May 2017, the Company announced an increase to its capital return program by raising the total size of the program from $250
billion to $300 billion. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion and raising its

Gross Margin
Gross margin for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows (dollars in millions):
2018 2017 2016
Net sales $ 265,595 $ 229,234 $ 215,639

prices and higher Services net sales, partially offset by higher product cost structures. Gross margin percentage decreased year-
over-year due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by higher Services net sales. The strength in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on gross margin and gross margin percentage during 2018.
Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 26
Gross margin increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to a shift in mix to Services and an overall increase in product
volumes. Gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year due primarily to higher product costs, partially offset by a favorable
shift in mix to Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on gross margin
and gross margin percentage during 2017.
The Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2019 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. The foregoing
statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2019 is forward-looking and could differ
from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set
forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the
Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors,
including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in
response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products;
compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company’s
ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic,
currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company’s frequent introductions and
transitions of products and services.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2018 Change 2017 Change 2016
Research and development $ 14,236 23% $ 11,581 15% $ 10,045

Total operating expenses $ 30,941 15% $ 26,842 11% $ 24,239
Percentage of total net sales 12% 12% 11%
Research and Development
The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, infrastructure-
related costs and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. R&D expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due
primarily to increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company
continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and
to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.
Selling, General and Administrative
The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in in headcount-
related expenses, professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense
in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and
infrastructure-related costs.
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows (dollars in millions):
2018 Change 2017 Change 2016
Interest and dividend income $ 5,686 $ 5,201 $ 3,999
Interest expense (3,240) (2,323) (1,456)
Other expense, net (441) (133) (1,195)
Total other income/(expense), net $ 2,005 (27)% $ 2,745 104% $ 1,348
The year-over-year decrease in other income/(expense), net during 2018 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and
the impact of foreign exchange–related items, partially offset by higher interest income. The year-over-year increase in other
income/(expense), net during 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange–related
items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.16%, 1.99% and 1.73% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 27
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2018 2017 2016
Provision for income taxes $ 13,372 $ 15,738 $ 15,685
Effective tax rate 18.3% 24.6% 25.6%
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act
lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a
deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory
federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain
future foreign earnings.
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on
foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.
The Company’s effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 were lower than the historical statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due
primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland,
for which no U.S. taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to the lower 2018 blended U.S. tax rate, partially offset by
the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016
was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher U.S. R&D tax credits.
As a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), in 2018, the Company records any excess tax
benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes. The Company anticipates that these excess
tax benefits or deficiencies will have the greatest impact on its effective tax rates in the first and third quarters, as the majority of the
Company’s equity awards vest in those quarters.
As of September 29, 2018, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax
credits of $6.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $426 million. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted
income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate
the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing
tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the
“State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the
period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 billion. Irish
legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company
believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes
potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in
the Act. As of September 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted
from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.
On July 24, 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the U.S. Tax Court's decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner,
regarding the inclusion of share-based compensation in cost-sharing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries. The reversal was
subsequently withdrawn, and the Company believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from
the final resolution of the case.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Hedging
In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair
value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and
presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified
retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 28
Income Taxes
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than
Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset,
other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified
retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company estimates recording $3 billion of net deferred tax assets on its Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of
intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the new
minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as
these net deferred tax assets are utilized.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for
lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method
through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of September 29, 2018, the Company anticipates recording lease
assets and liabilities of approximately $8.9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the
Company’s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.
Financial Instruments
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019
utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, the adoption
of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial
instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method.
Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the
adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which
amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition
of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.
Subsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 and its related ASUs are
collectively referred to herein as the “new revenue standard.” The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each
prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt
the new revenue standard in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standard will
not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Form 10-K for more information on the prior period reclassification related to the Company’s adoption of ASU 2016-09.
The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its
working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its
existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share
repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities.
In connection with the State Aid Decision, as of September 29, 2018, the entire recovery amount of €13.1 billion plus interest of €1.2
billion was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.
The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective
of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment
grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
During 2018, cash generated by operating activities of $77.4 billion was a result of $59.5 billion of net income and an increase in the
net change in operating assets and liabilities of $34.7 billion, partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net income of $16.8 billion.
Cash generated by investing activities of $16.1 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of proceeds from maturities and sales of
marketable securities, net of purchases, of $32.4 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of
$13.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $87.9 billion during 2018 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common
stock of $72.7 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $13.7 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $6.5
billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $7.0 billion.
During 2017, cash generated by operating activities of $64.2 billion was a result of $48.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments
to net income of $20.8 billion and a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $4.9 billion, which included a
one-time payment of $1.9 billion related to a multi-year license agreement. Cash used in investing activities of $46.4 billion during
2017 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $33.1 billion and cash
used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $12.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $18.0 billion during 2017 consisted
primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $32.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.8
billion and cash used to repay term debt of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of term debt, net of $28.7
billion and proceeds from commercial paper, net of $3.9 billion.
Capital Assets
The Company’s capital expenditures were $16.7 billion during 2018. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $14.0 billion
for capital expenditures during 2019, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate
facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.
Debt
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The
Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share
repurchases. As of September 29, 2018, the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average
interest rate of 2.18% and maturities generally less than nine months.
Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 30
As of September 29, 2018, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate
principal amount of $104.2 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2018, the Company issued $7.0 billion and repaid $6.5 billion of
Notes. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In
addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the
Notes.
Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form
10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 2, “Financial Instruments” and Note 5, “Debt.”
Capital Return Program
During 2018, the Company repurchased 405.5 million shares of its common stock for $73.1 billion in connection with two separate
share repurchase programs. Of the $73.1 billion, $44.0 billion was repurchased under the Company’s previous share repurchase
program of up to $210 billion, thereby completing that program. On May 1, 2018, the Company announced the Board of Directors
had authorized a new program to repurchase up to $100 billion of the Company’s common stock. The remaining $29.0 billion
repurchased during 2018 was in connection with the new share repurchase program. The Company’s new share repurchase
program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under this program, shares may be repurchased in privately
negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
On May 1, 2018, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.63 to
$0.73 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2018. The Company intends to increase its dividend on
an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. The Company plans to use current cash and cash generated from
ongoing operating activities to fund its share repurchase program and quarterly cash dividend.
Contractual Obligations
The following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September 29, 2018, and excludes amounts already
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt and the deemed repatriation tax payable (in millions):
Payments Due Payments Due Payments Due Payments Due
in 2019 in 2020–2021 in 2022–2023 After 2023 Total

(1) Represents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, substantially all of which is noncancelable.
Operating Leases
The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-
year renewal options.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final
assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand
information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual
components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.
Other Purchase Obligations
The Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling
and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and
telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.

Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable
As of September 29, 2018, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet
consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax
payable in installments in accordance with the Act.
Other Non-Current Liabilities
The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation
table.
Indemnification
Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and
damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the
opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a
material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.
The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the
U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount
when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee
liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability
recognized within revenue.
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the
Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of
their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related
legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to
make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage
may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of
the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.
Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation
and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase
commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these
policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they
require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has
reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of
Directors.

Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service
and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it
has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the
U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains
a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms,
revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or
determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company
recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the
hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting
guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following
types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software
bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality,
undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the
Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a
hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists
only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone
basis.
For sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future
unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the
Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated
to these rights and services based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-
software services based on the Company’s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the
software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.
The Company’s process for determining ESPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over
time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change,
the Company’s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related
to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-
software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated
period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive
programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded,
provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been
met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates
can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized
at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also
records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Future market
conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions
to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who
will actually redeem the incentive. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions
of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would
be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company’s operating results.

Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities
The Company’s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to
changes in the fair value of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company’s net
income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the
sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security’s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its
investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an
impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among
other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and
any changes thereto; and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before
recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company’s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could
change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an
adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.
Inventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation
Fees
The Company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturing-related
assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities. In addition, the Company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers
associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory. The Company performs a regular review of inventory
that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels
and component cost trends. If the Company determines inventories of components and products, including third-party products held
for resale, have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value, it records a write-down of the
inventories. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines
that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset
exceeds its fair value. Any write-downs and/or impairments the Company may be required to record would adversely affect the
Company’s financial condition and operating results.
The Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or
are expected to be canceled. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing
requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the
Company’s products, a change in the Company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological
requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would
adversely affect its operating results.
Warranty Costs
The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and
projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the
Company’s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual
product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could
materially affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.
Income Taxes
The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for
income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities,
and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted
tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The
Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be
realized.
The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement.
