This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018.
Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be
found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years
2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first quarter
of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.
Fiscal 2019 Highlights
Total net sales decreased 2% or $5.4 billion during 2019 compared to 2018, driven by lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by
higher net sales of Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services in all geographic operating segments. The weakness in foreign
currencies had a significant unfavorable impact on net sales during 2019.
In April 2019, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175
billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share beginning in May 2019. During 2019, the Company
repurchased $67.1 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion.

Products and Services Performance
Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud
services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the
Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework.
As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.
The following table shows net sales by category for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions):
2019 Change 2018 Change 2017
Net sales by category:
iPhone (1) $ 142,381 (14)% $ 164,888 18 % $ 139,337
Mac (1) 25,740 2 % 25,198 (1)% 25,569
iPad (1) 21,280 16 % 18,380 (2)% 18,802
Wearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 24,482 41 % 17,381 36 % 12,826
Services (3) 46,291 16 % 39,748 22 % 32,700
Total net sales $ 260,174 (2)% $ 265,595 16 % $ 229,234
(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price
of the respective product.
(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and
Apple-branded and third-party accessories.
(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare, licensing and other
services. Services net sales also include amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the
sales price of certain products.
iPhone
iPhone net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone unit sales.
Mac
Mac net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of MacBook Air, partially offset by lower net
sales of MacBook® and MacBook Pro®.
iPad
iPad net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of iPad Pro.
Wearables, Home and Accessories
Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales of AirPods
and Apple Watch.
Services
Services net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher net sales from the App Store, licensing and
AppleCare.

Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas,
Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes
European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of
Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the
reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better
align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic
region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”
The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions):
2019 Change 2018 Change 2017
Net sales by reportable segment:
Americas $ 116,914 4 % $ 112,093 16% $ 96,600
Europe 60,288 (3)% 62,420 14% 54,938
Greater China 43,678 (16)% 51,942 16% 44,764
Japan 21,506 (1)% 21,733 23% 17,733
Rest of Asia Pacific 17,788 2 % 17,407 15% 15,199
Total net sales $ 260,174 (2)% $ 265,595 16% $ 229,234
Americas
Americas net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher Services and Wearables, Home and
Accessories net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had
an unfavorable impact on Americas net sales during 2019.
Europe
Europe net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Wearables,
Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significant
unfavorable impact on Europe net sales during 2019.
Greater China
Greater China net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher
Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an
unfavorable impact on Greater China net sales during 2019.
Japan
Japan net sales decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower iPhone net sales, partially offset by higher Services and
Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales. The value of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar had a favorable impact on
Japan net sales during 2019.
Rest of Asia Pacific
Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher Wearables, Home and Accessories
and Services net sales, partially offset by lower iPhone net sales. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had
a significant unfavorable impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during 2019.

Gross Margin
Products and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2019 2018 2017
Gross margin:
Products $ 68,887 $ 77,683 $ 70,197
Services 29,505 24,156 17,989
Total gross margin $ 98,392 $ 101,839 $ 88,186
Gross margin percentage:
Products 32.2% 34.4% 35.7%
Services 63.7% 60.8% 55.0%
Total gross margin percentage 37.8% 38.3% 38.5%
Products Gross Margin
Products gross margin and Products gross margin percentage decreased during 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower
iPhone unit sales and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
Products gross margin increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due primarily to a favorable shift in mix of iPhones and the strength
in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher product cost structures. Year-over-year Products gross
margin percentage decreased during 2018 due primarily to higher product cost structures, partially offset by the strength in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
Services Gross Margin
Year-over-year Services gross margin increased during 2019 and 2018 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different
services mix. Year-over-year Services gross margin percentage increased during 2019 and 2018 due primarily to a different services
mix and leverage of the Company’s services fixed cost structure from higher Services net sales.
The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under
the heading “Risk Factors”. As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain
under downward pressure.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2019 Change 2018 Change 2017
Research and development $ 16,217 14% $ 14,236 23% $ 11,581
Percentage of total net sales 6% 5% 5%
Selling, general and administrative $ 18,245 9% $ 16,705 9% $ 15,261
Percentage of total net sales 7% 6% 7%
Total operating expenses $ 34,462 11% $ 30,941 15% $ 26,842
Percentage of total net sales 13% 12% 12%
Research and Development
The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. The Company
continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and
to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.
Selling, General and Administrative
The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-
related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising and infrastructure-related costs.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 21
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (dollars in millions):
2019 Change 2018 Change 2017
Interest and dividend income $ 4,961 $ 5,686 $ 5,201
Interest expense (3,576) (3,240) (2,323)
Other income/(expense), net 422 (441) (133)
Total other income/(expense), net $ 1,807 (10)% $ 2,005 (27)% $ 2,745
The year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2019 was due primarily to lower interest income and higher interest expense, partially
offset by the impact of foreign exchange–related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.19% and 2.16% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (dollars
in millions):
2019 2018 2017
Provision for income taxes $ 10,481 $ 13,372 $ 15,738
Effective tax rate 15.9% 18.3% 24.6%
Statutory federal income tax rate 21.0% 24.5% 35.0%
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act
lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a
deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory
federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the “2018 blended U.S. tax rate”). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain
foreign earnings.
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on
foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the
2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred
tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in
2019 and the impact of the Act in 2018, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019.
As of September 28, 2019, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits
of $14.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $6.2 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,
including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the
amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Hedging
In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12
expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the
separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020
utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company’s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the
adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial
instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method.
Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the
adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 22
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for
lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method
through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates
recording lease-related assets and liabilities of approximately $8 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, with no
material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Financial Statements in Note 5, “Income Taxes.”
The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly rated securities, with the primary objective
of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment
grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.

adjustments to net income of $17.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.5
billion. Cash generated by investing activities of $45.9 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities
of marketable securities, net of purchases, of $57.5 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of
$10.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $91.0 billion during 2019 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common
stock of $66.9 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.1 billion, cash used to repay term debt of $8.8

Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 24
Other Purchase Obligations
The Company’s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling
and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and
telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.
Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable
As of September 28, 2019, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet
consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax
payable in installments in accordance with the Act.
Other Non-Current Liabilities
The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a
reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual
obligation table.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant
accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
these estimates, and such differences may be material.
Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation
of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes,
and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of
the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about
inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related
disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Revenue Recognition
The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone,
Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated
sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to
receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to
receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device.
The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone
selling prices (“SSPs”). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of
revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified
software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be
provided.
The Company’s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management’s judgment and considers multiple factors that may
vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and
circumstances change, the Company’s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and
unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the
nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the
estimated period they are expected to be provided.
