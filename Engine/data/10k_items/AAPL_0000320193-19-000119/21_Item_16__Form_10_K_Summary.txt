Item 16. Form 10-K Summary

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 28, 2019 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and
communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Company’s assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s
internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in
future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment,
management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2019 to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2019, which were
identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
