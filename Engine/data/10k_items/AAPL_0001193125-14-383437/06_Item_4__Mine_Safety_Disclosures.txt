Apple eBooks Antitrust Litigation (United States of America v. Apple Inc., et al.)
On April 11, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust action against the Company and five major book publishers in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in
violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, the District Court’s declaration that the
Company’s agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the District Court’s reformation of such agreements. On
July 10, 2013, the District Court found, following a bench trial, that the Company conspired to restrain trade in violation of §1 of the
Sherman Act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with §1 of the Sherman Act. The District Court
entered a permanent injunction, which took effect on October 6, 2013 and will be in effect for five years unless the judgment is
overturned on appeal. The Company has taken the necessary steps to comply with the terms of the District Court’s order, including
renegotiating agreements with the five major eBook publishers, updating its antitrust training program and hiring an antitrust
compliance monitor. The Company appealed the District Court’s decision. Pursuant to a settlement agreement reached by the
parties in June 2014, any damages the Company may be obligated to pay will be determined by the outcome of the appellate
decision.
