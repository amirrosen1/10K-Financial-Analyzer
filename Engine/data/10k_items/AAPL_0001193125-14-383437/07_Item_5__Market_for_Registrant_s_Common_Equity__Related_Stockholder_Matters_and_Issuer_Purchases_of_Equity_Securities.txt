Apple eBooks Antitrust Litigation (United States of America v. Apple Inc., et al.)
On April 11, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust action against the Company and five major book publishers in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging an unreasonable restraint of interstate trade and commerce in
violation of §1 of the Sherman Act and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, the District Court’s declaration that the
Company’s agency agreements with the publishers are null and void and/or the District Court’s reformation of such agreements. On
July 10, 2013, the District Court found, following a bench trial, that the Company conspired to restrain trade in violation of §1 of the
Sherman Act and relevant state statutes to the extent those laws are congruent with §1 of the Sherman Act. The District Court
entered a permanent injunction, which took effect on October 6, 2013 and will be in effect for five years unless the judgment is
overturned on appeal. The Company has taken the necessary steps to comply with the terms of the District Court’s order, including
renegotiating agreements with the five major eBook publishers, updating its antitrust training program and hiring an antitrust
compliance monitor. The Company appealed the District Court’s decision. Pursuant to a settlement agreement reached by the
parties in June 2014, any damages the Company may be obligated to pay will be determined by the outcome of the appellate
decision.

(1) In 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company’s common
stock beginning in 2013. The Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization to $60 billion
in April 2013 and to $90 billion in April 2014. As of September 27, 2014, $67.9 billion of the $90 billion had been utilized.
The remaining $22.1 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase
program as of September 27, 2014. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific
number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions,
including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
(2) In August 2014, the Company entered into a new accelerated share repurchase arrangement (“ASR”) to purchase up to $9.0
billion of the Company’s common stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $9.0 billion, the financial institutions
committed to deliver shares during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before February 2015. The total number of
shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable
purchase period based on the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that period. During the
fourth quarter of 2014, 59.9 million shares were delivered and retired under the ASR, and the final number of shares to be
delivered will be determined at the conclusion of the purchase period.
