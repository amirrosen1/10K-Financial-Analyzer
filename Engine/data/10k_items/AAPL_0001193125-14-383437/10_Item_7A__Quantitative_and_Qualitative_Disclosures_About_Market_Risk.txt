Legal and Other Contingencies
As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies,” the Company is subject to various legal
proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss
has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability
determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a
reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with
respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought
against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an
outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in
excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management
The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone
basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the
Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the
recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the
underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.
Interest Rate Risk
While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, the Company’s
interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the
interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as
costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.
Investments
The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity
requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and
achieve its investment objectives.
The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio. The Company typically
invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The
policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss.
To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company
performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment
portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27, 2014, a
hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.4 billion incremental decline in the fair
market value of the portfolio. As of September 28, 2013, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a
$2.7 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the
investments prior to maturity.

Debt
In April 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue Commercial Paper pursuant to a commercial paper program.
As of September 27, 2014, the Company had $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with maturities generally less than nine
months.
In the third quarters of 2014 and 2013, the Company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. The debt
issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion
(collectively the “Notes”). The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate
risk on the Notes. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or
floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an
aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into floating-rate notes, and in the
third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which
effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes. As of September 27, 2014, a 100 basis point increase in market
interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt to increase by $110 million on an annualized basis.
Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Note 6, “Debt.”
Foreign Currency Risk
In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in
particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.
dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there
have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign
exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash
flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange
exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a
variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures.
To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency
derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact
of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random
market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence
interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended
to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions.
Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the
model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of
$240 million as of September 27, 2014 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of September 28, 2013.
Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments
are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from
the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27, 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and
amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.
