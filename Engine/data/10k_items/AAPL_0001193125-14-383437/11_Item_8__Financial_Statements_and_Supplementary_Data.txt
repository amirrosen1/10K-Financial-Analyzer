Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and markets mobile
communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software,
services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company sells its products
worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers,
wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod
compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells
to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers.
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years
2014, 2013 and 2012 ended on September 27, 2014, September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively. An additional
week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal years
2014 and 2013 spanned 52 weeks each. Fiscal year 2012 spanned 53 weeks, with a 14th week included in the first quarter of 2012.
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in
September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
During the first quarter of 2014, the Company adopted updated accounting standards that (i) required disclosure of additional
information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) by component and (ii) required
gross and net disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The adoption of these updated standards only impacted the
disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; accordingly, the adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations. The Company has provided these additional disclosures in this Form 10-K in Note 8,
“Comprehensive Income” and Note 2, “Financial Instruments,” respectively.
Common Stock Split
On June 6, 2014, the Company effected a seven-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of June 2, 2014. All share and per
share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.
Revenue Recognition
Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories and service
and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it
has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales,
these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the
U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains
a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products,
software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the
iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software
products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the
hardware.
Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 50
Table of Contents
For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because
the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor
to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App
Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not determine the selling
price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis
by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is
remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of
services. This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and non-software
services that are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online
stores, and also sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The Company
records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from
AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. AppleCare service and
support contracts typically include extended phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools
offered under the Company’s standard limited warranty.
The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive
programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded.
For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at
which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to
revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes
collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until
remitted to the relevant government authority.
Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables
For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product’s functionality,
undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the
Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a
hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). VSOE generally exists
only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone
basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance, the
Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does not exist revenue is
recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.
For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch (“iOS devices”), Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it
may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of
these hardware products free of charge to customers. Essential software for iOS devices includes iOS and related applications and
for Mac includes OS X and related applications. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying
versions of iOS devices and Mac. The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving
the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device
delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iOS devices, Mac and
Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product’s
essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac.
The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has
neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the
delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue
recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified

Table of Contents
software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period
the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to
four years. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are
recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and
engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.
The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary
depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The Company believes its customers would be
reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products. This
view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a
particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. The Company also believes its
customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the non-software services because other companies offer
similar services at little or no cost to users. Therefore, the Company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to
the non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights and services attached to iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the
selling prices would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for software upgrade rights
include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing of Apple-branded and third-party Mac and
iOS compatible software, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified versus specified) and the relative ESP of the upgrade
rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate,
including the impact of other products and services provided to customers, the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist,
product-specific business objectives and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available. When relevant, the
same factors are considered by the Company in developing ESPs for offerings such as the non-software services with additional
consideration given to the estimated cost to provide such services.
In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company’s combined ESPs for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the
non-software services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from $5 to $40. As of September 27, 2014, the
combined ESPs for Mac was $40 and for iPhone and iPad ranged from $15 to $25. Revenue allocated to such rights is deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the rights are expected to be provided for each device, which ranges
from two to four years.
Shipping Costs
For all periods presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the
Company’s shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
Warranty Costs
The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary
based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
Software Development Costs
Research and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and
ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon
after technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not
significant, and software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2014, 2013 and 2012.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was
$1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Share-based Compensation
The Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange
for (a) equity instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or
that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted
stock units (“RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The
Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-
based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance metrics. The Company
recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax
benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax credits, foreign
tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding
share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans” of this Form 10-K.
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized
or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be
sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, “Income Taxes” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had
been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Company’s
employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is
reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in
the fair market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (net income in millions

Potentially dilutive securities, the effect of which would have been antidilutive, were not significant for 2014, 2013 and 2012. The
Company excluded these securities from the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Financial Instruments
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The
Company’s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance
sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s
underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and
marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. The Company classifies its marketable
equity securities, including mutual funds, as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for
use in current operations. The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains
and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders’ equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific
identification method.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value.
For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow
hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders’
equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The
ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in current income. To receive hedge
accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged
transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and are recognized in income. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an
asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. For
derivative instruments designated as a hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign
operation, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign
currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes
changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or
losses related to this component are recognized in current income. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair
value through current income.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers
historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic
conditions and other factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If the cost of the inventories
exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to
five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease
terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software
that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and
amortization expense on property and equipment was $6.9 billion, $5.8 billion and $2.6 billion during 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.

Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles,
excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their
carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and equipment, inventory
component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals
the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. The Company did not record any significant impairments
during 2014, 2013 and 2012.
The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, rather such assets are required to be
tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be
impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company
did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2014, 2013 and 2012. The
Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment,
goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In 2014 and 2013, the Company’s
goodwill was allocated to the Americas and Europe reportable operating segments.
The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for
impairment. The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to
seven years.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price
that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at
fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-
based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in
valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes
the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of
input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical
or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities
were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair
value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings,
were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.
In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.

Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using
exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that
approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency
translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency
remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and
nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements were not significant during 2014,
2013 and 2012 and have been included in the Company’s results of operations.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not
limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The net realized gains or losses recognized by the
Company, related to such sales, were not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012. The maturities of the Company’s long-term
marketable securities generally range from one to five years.
As of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a
continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant.
As of September 27, 2014, the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to
be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests
in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally
requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values
were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary
impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the
financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates, and the Company’s intent to sell, or
whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis. During
2014, 2013 and 2012 the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges.

Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. The Company may
enter into forward contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future
cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company
may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the
prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of
the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.
To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the U.S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company’s subsidiaries whose
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not
denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency
exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
currencies.
The Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These instruments may
offset a portion of changes in income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company’s long-term debt or investments.
The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s accounting treatment for
these instruments is based on the hedge designation. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the
hedged item is recognized in earnings. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along
with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item. The effective portions of net
investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense. Derivatives that are
not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the
derivative relates.
Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net
sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of
inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized.
Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other
income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The Company’s foreign currency and
interest rate transactions hedged with cash flow hedges as of September 27, 2014 are expected to occur within 12 months and four
years, respectively.
Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged
transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and
losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. Any
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-
designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of
hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2014, 2013 and 2012.
The gain/loss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging
instruments was not significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative
contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
contracts.

Table of Contents
The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts
associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013 (in millions):
2014 2013
Notional Credit Risk Notional Credit Risk
Amount Amounts Amount Amounts
Instruments designated as accounting hedges:
Foreign exchange contracts $42,945 $ 1,333 $35,013 $ 159
Interest rate contracts $12,000 $ 89 $ 3,000 $ 44
Instruments not designated as accounting hedges:
Foreign exchange contracts $38,510 $ 222 $16,131 $ 25
The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not
represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross
exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform
according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s
gross exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The Company’s
exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects
the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with
the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of
these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions
during the remaining life of the instruments.
The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net
settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral
security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their
gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 27, 2014, the Company received $2.1 billion of cash collateral
related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 28, 2013, the Company posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments
under its collateral security arrangements of $164 million, which were recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet. The Company did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it to post
additional collateral as of September 27, 2014 or September 28, 2013.
Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is
allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 27, 2014 and
September 28, 2013, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the
effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.6 billion and $333 million,
respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $549 million and $57 million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,
value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company
generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit
credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain
customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are
directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any
recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of September 27, 2014, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which
accounted for 16% and the other 13%. As of September 28, 2013, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more
of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 13% and the other 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted
for 72% and 68% of trade receivables as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, respectively. The additions and write-offs
to the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were not significant.
Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these
manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases
these components directly from suppliers. Three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14% of total vendor non-
trade receivables as of September 27, 2014 and three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 47%, 21% and 15% of total vendor
non-trade receivables as of September 28, 2013. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does
not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as
a reduction of cost of sales.

Note 4 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming music
service, and Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes Beats® headphones, speakers and audio software (collectively, “Beats”). The total
purchase price consideration for these acquisitions was $2.6 billion, which consisted primarily of cash, of which $2.2 billion was
allocated to goodwill, $636 million to acquired intangible assets and $258 million to net liabilities assumed. Concurrent with the close
of the acquisition, the Company repaid $295 million of existing Beats outstanding debt to third-party creditors. In conjunction with the
Beats acquisitions, the Company issued approximately 5.1 million shares of its common stock to certain former equity holders of
Beats. The restricted stock was valued at approximately $485 million based on the Company’s common stock on the acquisition
date. The majority of these shares, valued at approximately $417 million, will vest over time based on continued employment with

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of $33.6 billion, $30.5 billion and $36.8 billion in 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company’s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on undistributed
earnings that the Company does not intend to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s
undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. were generated by
subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%. As of September 27, 2014, U.S. income taxes have not
been provided on a cumulative total of $69.7 billion of such earnings. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to
these temporary differences is estimated to be approximately $23.3 billion.
As of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, $137.1 billion and $111.3 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated
holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S.
A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35%
in 2014, 2013 and 2012) to income before provision for income taxes for 2014, 2013 and 2012, is as follows (dollars in millions):
2014 2013 2012
Computed expected tax $18,719 $17,554 $19,517
State taxes, net of federal effect 469 508 677

Provision for income taxes $ 13,973 $ 13,118 $ 14,030
Effective tax rate 26.1% 26.2% 25.2%
The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock options,
the Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the tax effect of the difference between the fair market value of the stock
issued at the time of the exercise and the exercise price. For RSUs, the Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s
vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from equity
awards of $706 million, $643 million and $1.4 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which were reflected as increases to
common stock.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences
between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and
penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of September 27, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.0 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized,
would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2013, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
$2.7 billion, of which $1.4 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.
The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2014, 2013 and
2012, is as follows (in millions):

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of
September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $630 million and $590
million, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters,
the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $40 million, $189 million and $140 million,
respectively.
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) concluded its review of the
years 2004 through 2009, which resulted in the Company reducing its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $570 million and
recognizing a tax benefit of $166 million. The IRS is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012. In addition, the Company is
also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent
to 1996 and 2002, respectively, generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.
Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are
resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for
income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the
Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12
months.
Note 6 – Debt
Commercial Paper
In April 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”)
pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company intends to use net proceeds from the commercial paper program for
general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 27, 2014, the Company had $6.3 billion of
Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities generally less than nine months.
The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for 2014 (in

Long-Term Debt
In the third quarter of 2014 and 2013, the Company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. The debt
issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion
(collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the floating-
rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes.

The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. Such
swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-
rate payments. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0
billion, which effectively converted the fixed-rate notes due 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2024 into floating-rate notes. In the third quarter of
2013, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted
the floating-rate notes due 2016 and 2018 into fixed-rate notes.
The effective rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if applicable, adjustments
related to hedging. The Company recognized $381 million and $136 million of interest expense on its long-term debt for the years
ended September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, respectively. The Company did not have any long-term debt in 2012.

Share Repurchase Program
In 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company’s common stock
beginning in 2013. The Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to $60 billion in April 2013 and
to $90 billion in April 2014. As of September 27, 2014, $67.9 billion of the $90 billion had been utilized. The Company’s share
repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased
in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
The Company has entered into four accelerated share repurchase arrangements (“ASRs”) with financial institutions beginning in
August 2012. In exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the
purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per
share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-average price of
the Company’s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front
payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in the periods the
payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of
calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable
criteria for equity classification, and therefore, were not accounted for as derivative instruments.
The following table presents the Company’s ASRs:

(1) “Number of Shares” represents those shares delivered in advance of settlement and does not represent the final number of
shares to be delivered under the ASRs. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase
price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume weighted-average
price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The August 2014 ASR and January 2014 ASR purchase periods will
end in or before February 2015 and December 2014, respectively.

Note 8 – Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and OCI. OCI refers to revenue, expenses, and gains and losses
that under GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s OCI
consists of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, net
deferred gains and losses on certain derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities classified as available-for-sale.

Note 9 – Benefit Plans
Stock Plans
2014 Employee Stock Plan
In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the
Company’s authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-
based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based
awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally
vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a
one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for
grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number
of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld.
Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the
same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions
as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014
Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the
2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are
withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of
September 27, 2014, approximately 492.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.
2003 Employee Stock Plan
The 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive
officers. The 2003 Plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock appreciation rights,
stock purchase rights and performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven to ten years
after the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with either
annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on
continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs,
other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same
vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying
shares vest. In the second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.

Table of Contents
1997 Director Stock Plan
The 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of
RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-
employee director joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and
(iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual
award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to these grants
without shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of
shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the
Director Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding
unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of September 27, 2014, approximately
1.2 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
During the fourth quarter of 2014, Section 16 officers Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio, Philip W. Schiller, D. Bruce
Sewell and Jeffrey E. Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An
equity trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the
amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the
Company’s employee and director equity plans.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock
during any calendar year. As of September 27, 2014, approximately 7.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the
Purchase Plan.
401(k) Plan
The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k)
Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($17,500 for
calendar year 2014). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a
maximum 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings. The Company’s matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $163 million, $135
million and $114 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units
A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2014, 2013 and 2012, is as follows:
Number of Weighted-Average Aggregate
RSUs Grant Date Fair Intrinsic Value
(in thousands) Value Per Share (in millions)
Balance at September 24, 2011 101,122 $ 33.07
RSUs granted 54,597 $ 61.62
RSUs vested (44,137) $ 29.32
RSUs cancelled (6,545) $ 36.57
Balance at September 29, 2012 105,037 $ 49.27
RSUs granted 39,415 $ 78.23
RSUs vested (42,291) $ 45.96
RSUs cancelled (8,877) $ 57.31
Balance at September 28, 2013 93,284 $ 62.24
RSUs granted 59,269 $ 74.54
RSUs vested (43,111) $ 57.29
RSUs cancelled (5,620) $ 68.47
Balance at September 27, 2014 103,822 $ 70.98 $ 10,460
The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $3.4 billion, $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld
shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes,
and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 15.6 million, 15.5 million
and 16.1 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates
as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were
$1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they
reduced and retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an
expense to the Company.
Stock Options
The Company had 6.6 million stock options outstanding as of September 27, 2014, with a weighted-average exercise price per
share of $21.99 and weighted-average remaining contractual term of 1.4 years, substantially all of which are exercisable. The
aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options outstanding as of September 27, 2014 was $520 million, which represents the value of
the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied
by the number of options outstanding. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise was $1.5 billion, $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion
for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $1.0 billion, $816 million and $567 million for 2014, 2013
and 2012, respectively. As of September 27, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options,
RSUs and restricted stock was $6.3 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years.
Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies
Accrued Warranty and Indemnification
The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware
products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its
service parts used to repair the Company’s hardware products. The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be
incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection,
historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that
are outside of the Company’s typical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty liabilities and
adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
The following table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
2014 2013 2012
Beginning accrued warranty and related costs $ 2,967 $ 1,638 $ 1,240
Cost of warranty claims (3,760) (3,703) (1,786)
Accruals for product warranty 4,952 5,032 2,184
Ending accrued warranty and related costs $ 4,159 $ 2,967 $ 1,638
The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the
software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments
resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was
not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of
its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a
liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 27, 2014 or September 28, 2013.
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the
Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of
their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal
proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make
under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in
each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such
obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product
Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, a number of
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating
results.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the
Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,
initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially
adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on
the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an
alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers
concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the
Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to
significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating
results.
Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A
significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single
locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the
Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the
Company’s operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production
commitments. The Company’s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.
Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments
Operating Leases
The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating lease arrangements.
The Company does not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility leases are typically
for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging
from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 27, 2014,
the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $5.0 billion, of which $3.6 billion
related to leases for retail space.
Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $717 million, $645 million and
$488 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having
remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 27, 2014, are as follows (in millions):
2015 $ 662
2016 676

Other Commitments
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final
assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand
information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual
components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information.
Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective
supplier. As of September 27, 2014, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and
component purchase commitments of $24.5 billion.
In addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $3.4 billion as of
September 27, 2014, which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing
process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.
Contingencies
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have
not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have
incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome
of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if
one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s
expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.
On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co.,
Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On March 6, 2014, the
District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930 million. Because the award is now
subject to appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in its results of operations.
VirnetX, Inc. v. Apple Inc. et al.
On August 11, 2010, VirnetX, Inc. filed an action against the Company alleging that certain of its products infringed on four patents
relating to network communications technology. On November 6, 2012, a jury returned a verdict against the Company, and awarded
damages of $368 million. On September 16, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision
in part, reversed in part, and vacated the damages award. The case has been remanded for further proceedings.

Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the
internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable
segments.
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas segment includes both North and
South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China
segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other
than those countries included in the Company’s other operating segments. The results of the Company’s geographic segments do
not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.”
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales through
the Company’s retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in
which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses
managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such
as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, other
separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. The Company does not include
intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.
Segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the Retail segment also includes capital assets. Segment assets
exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade
receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment,
capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the
geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail
segment were $484 million, $495 million and $858 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company’s total depreciation
and amortization was $7.9 billion, $6.8 billion and $3.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $441 million, $382
million and $319 million was related to the Retail segment in the respective years. Depreciation and amortization on segment assets
included in the geographic segments was not significant.
As the Company continues to expand its business, management believes collaboration across its online, Retail and indirect
channels is integral to better serve its customers and optimize its financial results. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015,
management will be assessing business performance and making decisions on a geographic basis, including the results of its retail
stores in each respective geographic segment. Accordingly, the Company will be changing its reportable segments to align with the
way the business is managed. The Company’s reportable operating segments will consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific operations, and the Retail segment will no longer be classified as a separate reportable segment.
The historical segment data for prior periods will be reclassified to reflect this change beginning in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-
Q for the quarter ending December 27, 2014.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 27, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Apple Inc. at September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Apple
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Apple Inc.
We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2014, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992
framework) (“the COSO criteria”). Apple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27,
2014, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
2014 consolidated financial statements of Apple Inc. and our report dated October 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
