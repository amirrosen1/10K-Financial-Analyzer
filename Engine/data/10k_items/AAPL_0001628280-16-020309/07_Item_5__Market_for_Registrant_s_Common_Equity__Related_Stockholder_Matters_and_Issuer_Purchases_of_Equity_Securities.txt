(1) In April 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company's share repurchase program authorization from $140 billion to
$175 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of September 24, 2016, $133 billion of the $175 billion had been utilized. The remaining
$42 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized repurchase program as of
September 24, 2016. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the
program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule
10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
(2) In May 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement ("ASR") to purchase up to $6.0 billion of the
Company's common stock. In August 2016, the purchase period for this ASR ended and an additional 12.3 million shares were delivered
and retired. In total, 60.5 million shares were delivered under this ASR at an average repurchase price of $99.25.
(3) In August 2016, the Company entered into a new ASR to purchase up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In exchange for an
up-front payment of $3.0 billion, the financial institution party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the Company during the
ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before November 2016. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the
average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume weighted-average price
of the Company’s common stock during that period.
