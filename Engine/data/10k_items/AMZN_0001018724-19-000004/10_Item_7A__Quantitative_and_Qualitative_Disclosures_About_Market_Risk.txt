Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market
values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in
Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
Capital Resources.”
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt.
Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial
statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of
interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We
generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income
securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may
suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.
The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including
principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2019 (in millions,
except percentages):

As of December 31, 2019, we had $24.8 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following
fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):
1.900% Notes due on August 21, 2020 $ 1,000
3.300% Notes due on December 5, 2021 $ 1,000
2.500% Notes due on November 29, 2022 $ 1,250
2.400% Notes due on February 22, 2023 $ 1,000
2.800% Notes due on August 22, 2024 $ 2,000
3.800% Notes due on December 5, 2024 $ 1,250
5.200% Notes due on December 3, 2025 $ 1,000
3.150% Notes due on August 22, 2027 $ 3,500
4.800% Notes due on December 5, 2034 $ 1,250
3.875% Notes due on August 22, 2037 $ 2,750
4.950% Notes due on December 5, 2044 $ 1,500
4.050% Notes due on August 22, 2047 $ 3,500
4.250% Notes due on August 22, 2057 $ 2,250
Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $27.8 billion as of December 31,
2019.
Foreign Exchange Risk
During 2019, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related
expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North
America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros,
British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our
internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange
rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or
losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $2.4 billion in
comparison with the prior year.
We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign
funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2019, of $15.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse
change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $765 million, $1.5 billion, and $3.1 billion. Fluctuations in fair
value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity
securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are
measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.
We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the
intercompany balances as of December 31, 2019, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result
in losses of $195 million, $385 million, and $775 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”
See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results
of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in
foreign exchange rates.
Equity Investment Risk
As of December 31, 2019, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was
$3.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $679 million of our investments as
of December 31, 2019, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative
assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment
exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to
fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee
securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of
private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market
sensitivities are not practicable.
