Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Amazon.com, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31,
2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) and our report dated January 30, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method for accounting for
leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of the The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in
Matter Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax
positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in
evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses
significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to
be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31,
2019, the Company accrued liabilities of $3.9 billion for various tax contingencies.
Auditing the measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of
whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various
tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and
legal rulings.

Table of Contents
How We Addressed We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies,
the Matter in Our including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained,
Audit management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related
disclosures.
We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in
assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the
specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our
procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s
correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are
based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax
laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies.
We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the
Company’s positions. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax
benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Company’s calculations. We have also evaluated the
Company’s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets,
consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical
stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and
fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish
and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global
compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide
services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and
video advertising.
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment
Information.”
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of
restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the reclassification of long-term
capital lease obligations that existed at December 31, 2018 from “Other long-term liabilities” to “Long-term lease liabilities” within
the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. See “Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted.”
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the
“Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we
are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities.
Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market,
Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August
28, 2017.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment,
commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor
funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For example, in Q4 2019 we
completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from three years to four years for servers in January
2020, which, based on servers that are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019, will have an anticipated
impact to our 2020 operating income of $2.3 billion.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined
under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings
per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.
42
Table of Contents
The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2017 2018 2019
Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 480 487 494
Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 13 10
Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 493 500 504
Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return
allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including
sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the
prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:
Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the
goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon
delivery, to the customer.
Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through
us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn
from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related
products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.
Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content
including audiobooks, digital video, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide
our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for
at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.
AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to
services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity
of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database,
are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in
connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.
Other - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the
number of clicks or impressions.
Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return
allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $468 million, $623 million, and $712 million as of
December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Additions to the allowance were $1.8 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion and deductions
from the allowance were $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Included in “Inventories” on our
consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $406 million, $519 million, and $629 million as of December 31, 2017, 2018, and
2019, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including
costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs
where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in
our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction
costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of
operations.
43
Table of Contents
Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives,
and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their
goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or
cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the
likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be
reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.
Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International
segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving,
inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and
related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from
customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to
third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.
Technology and Content
Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development
of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products
and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking
equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and
other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and
services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred.
Marketing
Marketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and
selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals
result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.
Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $6.3 billion,
$8.2 billion, and $11.0 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related
expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and
litigation costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the
service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of
our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated
method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or
updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period
estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and
employee level.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related
intangible asset amortization expense, and expenses related to legal settlements.
44
Table of Contents
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of adjustments to and gains on equity securities of $18 million, $145 million,
and $231 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019, equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $109 million, $(131) million, and $11 million
in 2017, 2018, and 2019, and foreign currency gains (losses) of $247 million, $(206) million, and $(20) million in 2017, 2018, and
2019.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are
subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings.
We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely
outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they
will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets,
including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such
jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.
We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first
step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than
not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to
measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We
consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments
and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in
income tax expense.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably
available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain
marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities
were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments
and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of cash,
cash equivalents, restricted cash, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.
We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, these
warrants had a fair value of $440 million and $669 million, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance
sheets. These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.

Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are
valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available
information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or
liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.
We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain
ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these
products are not included in our inventories.
We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide
manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and
help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device
components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable
commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur
additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.
Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to
customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, customer receivables, net, were $9.4 billion and $12.6 billion,
vendor receivables, net, were $3.2 billion and $4.2 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $710 million and $863 million. Seller
receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to
procure inventory.
We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred.
Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in
accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $348 million, $495 million, and $718 million
as of December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Additions to the allowance were $626 million, $878 million, and $1.0 billion, and
deductions to the allowance were $515 million, $731 million, and $793 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
Software Development Costs
We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use
software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs,
including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from
property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along
with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the
construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy
equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years for our
servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment
equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our
consolidated statements of operations.
Leases
We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are
generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under
finance leases are recorded in property and equipment, net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally
have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.
Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of
property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are
accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone
prices.
46
Table of Contents
Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a
discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value
of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments
reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the
lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.
When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the
leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification
and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices,
market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.
Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of
the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest
component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.
We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination
or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are
accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.
Financing Obligations
We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control
over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the
arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or
the term of the obligation.
If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are
derecognized, and we classify the lease as either operating or finance.
Goodwill
We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative
assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our
qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test
goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the
reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than
not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the
estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash
flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on
expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.
We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2019, and
determined that goodwill is not impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were
no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible
Assets.”
Other Assets
Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net
of accumulated amortization; video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain
equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to
collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; lease prepayments made prior to lease
commencement; and equity warrant assets.
Digital Video and Music Content
We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing
agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license
fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an
asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we
47
Table of Contents
amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line
basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are
expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost
of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average
remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.7 years.
Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major
geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs
or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is
primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 were $3.8 billion and $5.8 billion. Total video and music
expense was $6.7 billion and $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. Total video and music expense includes
licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with
digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.
Investments
We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term
fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”
Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise
significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our
consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis
differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated
statements of operations.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other
assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated
statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, these investments had a carrying value of $282 million and $1.5
billion.
Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated
balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statement
of operations.
We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and
equity-method investments, we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-
than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the
unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess
whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of
its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied
values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available
information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and
intentions for holding the investment.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment
include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an
asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets
may not be recoverable.
For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying
amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based
on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain
criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its
immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.

Table of Contents
Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and
asset retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital
media content, and other operating expenses.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion and our
liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a
customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is
recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime
memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018 was $7.9 billion, of which $6.3 billion was recognized as
revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $10.2 billion.
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion of unearned revenue
as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.
Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer
contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that
exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average
remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by
customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.
Other Long-Term Liabilities
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax
liabilities, financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.
Foreign Currency
We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly
incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that
either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a
separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on
our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our
consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we
recorded gains (losses) of $202 million, $(186) million, and $95 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to
understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We
adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and
increased retained earnings by approximately $650 million. The adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift
cards, which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the
likelihood of redemption becomes remote. We changed the recognition and classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which
are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales.
Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product
sales and service sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified
as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are presented
on a net basis. Prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting
policy.
The impact of applying this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and
an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately $3.8 billion. Service sales
also increased by approximately $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the reclassification of certain advertising
services.

In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and
disclosure of financial instruments. Under this ASU, certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized
in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases, primarily requiring the recognition of lease
assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the new
guidance, leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases
and financing obligations, respectively. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 by recording an immaterial cumulative
adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and
continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not
comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease
assets and liabilities of approximately $21 billion, which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating
leases of $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2018, amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled
$9.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and $5.4
billion and $1.5 billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases, respectively.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the
recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer
occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been
sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250 million to retained earnings and
deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.
In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements
of cash flows. The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements
of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements
of cash flows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Previously Reported Adjustments As Revised
Operating activities $ 18,434 $ (69) $ 18,365
Investing activities (27,819) 735 (27,084)
Financing activities 9,860 68 9,928
Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 475 $ 734 $ 1,209
In March 2019, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for film costs, inclusive of episodic television and movie
costs. The new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring
production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic
television content. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2019 and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs.
Adoption of this ASU resulted in approximately $1.0 billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in “Other Assets” as of
December 31, 2019.

Note 5 — ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
2017 Acquisition Activity
On May 12, 2017, we acquired Souq Group Ltd., an e-commerce company, for approximately $583 million, net of cash
acquired, and on August 28, 2017, we acquired Whole Foods Market, a grocery store chain, for approximately $13.2 billion, net of
cash acquired. Both acquisitions are intended to expand our retail presence. During 2017, we also acquired certain other companies
for an aggregate purchase price of $204 million. The primary reason for our other 2017 acquisitions was to acquire technologies
and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.
2018 Acquisition Activity
On April 12, 2018, we acquired Ring Inc. (“Ring”) for cash consideration of approximately $839 million, net of cash
acquired, and on September 11, 2018, we acquired PillPack, Inc. (“PillPack”) for cash consideration of approximately $753 million,
net of cash acquired, to expand our product and service offerings. During 2018, we also acquired certain other companies for an
aggregate purchase price of $57 million. The primary reason for our other 2018 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-
how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.
2019 Acquisition Activity
During 2019, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $315 million. The primary reason for these
acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire technologies and
know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.
Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of 2019 acquisitions, individually and in the
aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.

(1) Intangible assets acquired in 2017, 2018, and 2019 have estimated useful lives of between one and twenty-five years, two and
seven years, and two and seven years, with weighted-average amortization periods of twenty-one years, six years, and five
years.
We determined the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach.
These assets are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to operating expenses
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Goodwill
The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and
functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible
assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax
purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2018 and 2019 by segment (in millions):

(3) Issued in August 2017, effective interest rates of the 2020, 2023, 2024, 2027, 2037, 2047, and 2057 Notes were 2.16%, 2.56%,
2.95%, 3.25%, 3.94%, 4.13%, and 4.33%.
(4) Consists of $872 million of 2025 Notes issued in December 2017 in exchange for notes assumed in connection with the
acquisition of Whole Foods Market and $128 million of 2025 Notes issued by Whole Foods Market that did not participate in
our December 2017 exchange offer. The effective interest rate of the 2025 Notes was 3.02%.
Interest on the Notes issued in 2012 is payable semi-annually in arrears in May and November. Interest on the Notes issued in
2014 is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December. Interest on the Notes issued in 2017 is payable semi-annually in
arrears in February and August. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December. We may
redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any
financial covenants under the Notes. The proceeds from the November 2012 and the December 2014 Notes were used for general
corporate purposes. The proceeds from the August 2017 Notes were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole
Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was
approximately $24.3 billion and $26.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of
those dates.
In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller
receivables, which we subsequently increased to $740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender
approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered
rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.40%, and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There were $594 million and $740
million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, which had a weighted-average
interest rate of 3.2% and 3.4% as of December 31, 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, we
57
Table of Contents
have pledged $686 million and $852 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility.
The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of
December 31, 2018 and 2019.
The other debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 6.0% and 4.1% as of December 31,
2018 and 2019. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business operations. The
estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of
December 31, 2018 and 2019.
As of December 31, 2019, future principal payments for our total debt were as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2020 $ 1,307
2021 1,141
2022 1,773
2023 1,510
2024 3,339
Thereafter 15,750
$ 24,820
In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from
time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but
will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of
December 31, 2018 and 2019.
In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit
facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $7.0 billion. As
amended and restated, the Credit Agreement has a term of three years, but it may be extended for up to three additional one-year
terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the amended and restated Credit
Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50%, with a commitment fee of 0.04% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.

___________________
(1) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores and long-
term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For
those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum
quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option
of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.
(2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease
arrangements and lease arrangements prior to the lease commencement date and digital media content liabilities associated
with long-term digital media content assets with initial terms greater than one year.
(3) Excludes approximately $3.9 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of
the amount and period of payment, if any.
Pledged Assets
As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, we have pledged or otherwise restricted $575 million and $994 million of our cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-
party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller
receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.”
Suppliers
During 2019, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or
arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit
limits.
Other Contingencies
In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities
located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export
control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry,
office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have
voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States
Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their
review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information —
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.”
We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes),
including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to
pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South
Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including
interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on
59
Table of Contents
transactions by our third-party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the
Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without
merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were successfully to seek additional
adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:
Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and
several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated
federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and
Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v. Amazon.com, Inc.,
Zappos.com Inc., another affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Kentucky. In September 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of
Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In October 2013, Davis v.
Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and
former employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees
in states including Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, and Nevada, and one complaint
asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages,
interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme
Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the
federal wage and hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated
orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. In March 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of
Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the district court’s judgment to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of appeals affirmed the district court’s decision. In June
2017, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana cases with prejudice.
We dispute any remaining allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court
for the Western District of Washington. In June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January 2019, the stay of the case was lifted following resolution of the review
petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on
www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed
Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded
Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’
fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In
February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130-$250
million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

operating under a single operating system image”; 7,149,867, entitled “System and method of enhancing efficiency and utilization
of memory bandwidth in reconfigurable hardware”; 7,225,324 and 7,620,800, both entitled “Multi-adaptive processing systems and
techniques for enhancing parallelism and performance of computational functions”;
60
Table of Contents
and 9,153,311, entitled “System and method for retaining DRAM data when reprogramming reconfigurable devices with DRAM
memory controllers.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, interest, and a compulsory on-
going royalty. In February 2018, the Virginia district court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Western
District of Washington. In November 2018, the case was stayed pending resolution of eight review petitions filed with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office relating to the ‘324, ‘867, and ‘311 patents. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and
intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc.
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa

unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In November 2018, the case was transferred
to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In November 2019, the District Court entered judgment
invalidating all asserted claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,537,762; 9,813,330; 9,826,002; and 9,948,549. We dispute the allegations of
wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent

enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in this matter.
In April 2019, Vocalife LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com LLC in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Echo devices infringe U.S. Patent
No. RE47,049, entitled “Microphone Array System.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages,

In May 2019, Neodron Ltd. filed a petition with the United States International Trade Commission requesting that the
International Trade Commission commence an investigation into the sale of Amazon Fire HD 10 tablets and certain Dell, Hewlett
Packard, Lenovo, Microsoft, Motorola, and Samsung devices (the “accused devices”). Neodron’s petition alleges that the accused
devices infringe at least one of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,422,173, entitled “Capacitive Position Sensor”; 8,791,910, entitled “Capacitive
Keyboard With Position-Dependent Reduced Keying Ambiguity”; 9,024,790, entitled “Capacitive Keyboard With Non-Locking

exclusion order preventing the importation of the accused devices into the United States. In December 2019, Neodron withdrew its
infringement allegations against Amazon with regard to U.S. Patent No. 9,372,580. In May 2019, Neodron also filed a complaint
against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other
things, that Amazon’s Fire HD 10 tablet infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 8,422,173, entitled “Capacitive Position Sensor,” and 9,372,580,
entitled “Enhanced Touch Detection Methods.” The May 2019 complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and interest, a
permanent injunction, and enhanced damages. In June 2019, Neodron filed a second complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Fire HD
10 tablet infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 9,823,784, entitled “Capacitive Touch Screen With Noise Suppression”; 9,489,072, entitled
“Noise Reduction In Capacitive Touch Sensors”; and

8,502,547, entitled “Capacitive Sensor.” The June 2019 complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and interest, a
permanent injunction, and enhanced damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously
in these matters.
The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant
uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. In addition, for the matters
disclosed above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is
immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application
of non-monetary remedies.

As of December 31, 2019, there was $8.8 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based
compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with approximately half of the compensation
expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a weighted-average recognition period of 1.1 years. The estimated
forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 28%, 27%, and 27%. Changes in our estimates and assumptions
relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future.
During 2017, 2018, and 2019, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $6.8 billion, $11.4 billion, and $11.7
billion.
Common Stock Available for Future Issuance
As of December 31, 2019, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 108 million shares.
Note 9 — INCOME TAXES
In 2017, 2018, and 2019, we recorded net tax provisions of $769 million, $1.2 billion, and $2.4 billion. Tax benefits relating
to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income.
Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $957 million, $1.2 billion, and $881 million for 2017, 2018, and 2019.
The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate
income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions,
imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing
how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by
allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S.
Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax
benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount was primarily comprised of the
remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate
to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the
U.S. Tax Act.

(1) The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.
(2) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision
includes $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2017, 2018, and
2019.
Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the
one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the U.S.
federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an
increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in
which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including
recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-
forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we
64
Table of Contents
recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in
Luxembourg.
Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline
in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in
2018.
Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on
the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our
capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant,
additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.

___________________
(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.
(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign
taxing jurisdictions.
Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net
operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of
December 31, 2019 were approximately $8.6 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual
limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2020. As of December 31, 2019,
our federal tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.7 billion. If not utilized, a portion of the tax
credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027.
Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-
related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are
established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision
for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.

(1) As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $3.9 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $2.1 billion, if fully
recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax
contingencies of $127 million and $131 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years
ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019 was $40 million, $20 million, and $4 million.
We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year
2007 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net
operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.
In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax
authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union
rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities
in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission
announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014,
and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg
computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March
2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European
Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be without merit and will
continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign
jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to,
audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for
2009 and thereafter.
Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax
examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing
authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive
additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more
jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in
years through 2019. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any
settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.
Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment
results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on
usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs
are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred
in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable
segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and
manages its operations.

Table of Contents
North America
The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these
online stores.
International
The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these
internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and
Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.
AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other service offerings for
start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.
