We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign
jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax
collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax,
including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such
changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are
considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes,
targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales,
consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in
liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or
enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely
effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting
from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and
other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice
to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective
date.
Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions,
investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,
losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial
tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss
and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary
course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.
We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in
an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or
periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an
adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different
from our historical tax accruals.
We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations
Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement
regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and
investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and
administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of
fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic
funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.
