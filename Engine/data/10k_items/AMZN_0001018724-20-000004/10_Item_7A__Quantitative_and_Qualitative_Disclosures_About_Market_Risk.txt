Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing
Obligations
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is
free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under
finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance
leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of
property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash,
which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance
leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow
measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2019 2020
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064
Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044)
Free cash flow 25,825 31,020
Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (12,916) (9,104)
Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (392) (427)
Principal repayments of financing obligations (27) (53)
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases
and financing obligations $ 12,490 $ 21,436
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104)
___________________
(1) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment
acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million and $11,588 million.
(2) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance
leases” of $9,628 million and $10,642 million.
All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and
do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do
not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions.
Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time.
Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements
of cash flows.

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates
Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and
operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those
in effect in the comparable prior year periods. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes
in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2020

Guidance
We provided guidance on February 2, 2021, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-
looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results
are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,
changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce,
and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This guidance reflects our estimates as of
February 2, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is
highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the
pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the
impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our
significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and
consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are
uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns
over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional
assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of
2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially
affect our operations.
First Quarter 2021 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow between 33% and 40% compared with
first quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange
rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020.
This guidance assumes approximately $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.
