Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market
values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in
Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our
long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements.
However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates,
increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.
We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed
income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we
may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The
following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows
by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages):

As of December 31, 2021, we had long-term debt with a face value of $50.6 billion, including the current portion, primarily
consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 —
Debt” for additional information.

Foreign Exchange Risk
During 2021, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related
expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North
America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros,
British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our
internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange
rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses
on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year
compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $3.0 billion in comparison with the prior year.
We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign
funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2021, of $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse
change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 billion. Fluctuations in fair value
are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities
with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at
fair value with changes recognized in net income.
We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the
intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would
result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”
See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of
Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign
exchange rates.
Equity Investment Risk
As of December 31, 2021, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was
$22.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive,
Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market
price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in
private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to
the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that
market sensitivities are not practicable. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description
of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” for additional information.
