Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing
Obligations
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is
free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under
finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is
included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease
liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if
these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation
of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the
most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2021 and 2022 (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2021 2022
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,327 $ 46,752
Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (55,396) (58,321)
Free cash flow (9,069) (11,569)
Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (4,422) (299)
Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (687) (670)
Principal repayments of financing obligations (162) (248)
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases
and financing obligations $ (14,340) $ (12,786)
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (58,154) $ (37,601)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 6,291 $ 9,718
___________________
(1) For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment
acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications” of $7,061 million and $675 million.
(2) For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance
leases” of $11,163 million and $7,941 million.
All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and
do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do
not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions.
Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time.
Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements
of cash flows.

Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and
operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those
in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in
our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022
