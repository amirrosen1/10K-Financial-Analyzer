(1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits or shortfalls from stock-based compensation. Our
tax provision includes $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2020 and 2021,
and a $33 million tax shortfall from stock-based compensation for 2022.
(2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred
to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction.
Our provision for income taxes in 2021 was higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was
partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal research and development credits and the impact of the distribution of certain
intangible assets from Luxembourg to the U.S. in Q4 2021, resulting in the utilization of $2.6 billion of Luxembourg deferred tax
assets previously subject to a valuation allowance.
We generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a decrease
in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction. This was partially offset by a reduction in excess tax benefits
from stock-based compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable
effects of corporate restructuring transactions. The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022 reflects a change in our
application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes an income tax benefit of
approximately $655 million related to years prior to 2022.
We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,
indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such
amounts.
