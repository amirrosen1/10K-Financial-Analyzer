Table of Contents
The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded
for income taxes are as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2020 2021 2022
Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate $ 5,078 $ 8,012 $ (1,246)
Effect of:
Tax impact of foreign earnings and losses (538) (1,349) (370)
State taxes, net of federal benefits 343 465 (173)
Tax credits (639) (1,136) (1,006)
Stock-based compensation (1) (1,107) (1,094) 612
Foreign income deduction (2) (372) (301) (1,258)
Other, net 98 194 224
Total $ 2,863 $ 4,791 $ (3,217)
___________________
(1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits or shortfalls from stock-based compensation. Our
tax provision includes $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2020 and 2021,
and a $33 million tax shortfall from stock-based compensation for 2022.
(2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred
to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction.
Our provision for income taxes in 2021 was higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was
partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal research and development credits and the impact of the distribution of certain
intangible assets from Luxembourg to the U.S. in Q4 2021, resulting in the utilization of $2.6 billion of Luxembourg deferred tax
assets previously subject to a valuation allowance.
We generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a decrease
in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction. This was partially offset by a reduction in excess tax benefits
from stock-based compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable
effects of corporate restructuring transactions. The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022 reflects a change in our
application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes an income tax benefit of
approximately $655 million related to years prior to 2022.
We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,
indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such
amounts.

___________________
(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.
(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign
taxing jurisdictions or future capital gains, as well as tax credits.
Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net
operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of
December 31, 2022 were approximately $10.4 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual
limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2023.
Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-
related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are
established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision
for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
