(1) As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $4.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $2.2 billion, if fully
recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax
contingencies of $110 million and $103 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 were $(48) million, $28 million, and $(7) million.
We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and
thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating
losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.
We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India,
Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments
by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing
tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income.
In September 2022, the Luxembourg Tax Authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we
distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA’s position is without merit and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in this matter.
In February 2023, we received a decision by the Indian Tax Authority (“ITA”) that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to
the U.S. We will need to remit taxes on the services in question, including for a portion of prior years, until this matter is resolved,
which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA’s decision is without merit, we intend to defend our
position vigorously, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we would reflect significant additional
tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.
In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax
authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union
rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities
in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission
announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014,
and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg
computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we deposited into escrow in
March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European
Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European
Commission’s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice.
We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies.
Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory
processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts
ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is
reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly
reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes
to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly
depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible
outcomes.
