Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment
results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative”
based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology
infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology
costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between
our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business
performance and manages its operations.
North America
The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these
online stores.
International
The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these
internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and
Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.
AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-
ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.
Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions):
