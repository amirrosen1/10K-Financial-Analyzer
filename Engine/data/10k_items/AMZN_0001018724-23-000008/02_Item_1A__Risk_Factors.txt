Item 1A. Risk Factors
Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in
our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able
to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial
condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors
do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently
known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in
Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk
factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events
may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers,
including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us.
Business and Industry Risks
We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including
cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce
services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and
logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or
greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They
may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure,
fulfillment, and marketing.
Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-
funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market
segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and
infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital content, and
electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which
enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and
service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending
or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.
Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks
We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or
service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if
customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality
issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we
may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant.
Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the
6
Table of Contents
value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a
variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan
or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.
Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In
certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market
advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote
our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.
In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks,
including:
• local economic and political conditions;
• government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive
governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and
tariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); nationalization;
and restrictions on foreign ownership;
• restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products,
services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal
precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products
and enforcement of intellectual property rights;
• business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;
• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
• limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;
• shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;
• laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security,
consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;
• lower levels of use of the internet;
• lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;
• lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;
• difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural
differences;
• different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
• compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt
payments to government officials and other third parties;
• laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and
• geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.
As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will
intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage
because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The
inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.
The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country
through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT
infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and
services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain
technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In
India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand
retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to
enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller
on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve
unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in
7
Table of Contents
their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties
regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a
view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or
our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place.
Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and
regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses
revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.
In addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising
revenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade
restrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors
negatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.
The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality,
promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary
fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result
of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our
fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand
could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant
inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly
experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments
necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time
due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from
efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and
services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak
periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal
demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during
periods of high demand.
As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances
typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities)
because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a
corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. Our accounts
payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a
corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.
We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers
The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in
the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain
policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive
the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers
in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or
unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes
are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or
criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up
to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could
negatively affect our operating results.
We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing
Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar
intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and
confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective
intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also
may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore,
regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be
8
Table of Contents
unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our
trademarks and other proprietary rights.
We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken
by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The
protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the
steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing
or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise
acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.
We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement
by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the
future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for
damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed
their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase
in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers’ use of artificial
intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-
party technology or content.
Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital
content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content
providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.
We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product
and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ
materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we
have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash
equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen.
When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when
translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.
Operating Risks
Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service
offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our
business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial
resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage
growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.
We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales
estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly
enough if our sales are less than expected.
Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit
growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is
affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand,
whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased
revenue or growth.
Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this
section and the following:
• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;
• our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;
• our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;
• the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;
9
Table of Contents
• changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside
the U.S.;
• timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;
• the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;
• the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;
• the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and
could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;
• variations in the mix of products and services we sell;
• variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;
• the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits
to our customers;
• factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or
commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics), and public perceptions regarding
social or ethical issues related to our development and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies,
products, and services;
• the extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure, fulfillment, and other expense categories;
• availability of and increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), resources such as land, water, and energy,
commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products, including as
a result of inflationary pressures;
• constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;
• the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our
customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;
• our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;
• the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to
customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;
• the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service
attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events;
• the extent to which we fail to maintain our unique culture of innovation, customer obsession, and long-term thinking,
which has been critical to our growth and success;
• disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a
result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks, armed hostilities, and
political conflicts, including those involving China), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental actions
impacting us, our customers, and our third-party sellers and suppliers in China or other foreign countries), and similar
events; and
• potential negative impacts of climate change, including: increased operating costs due to more frequent extreme weather
events or climate-related changes, such as rising temperatures and water scarcity; increased investment requirements
associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy; decreased demand for our products and services as a result of
changes in customer behavior; increased compliance costs due to more extensive and global regulations and third-party
requirements; and reputational damage resulting from perceptions of our environmental impact.
We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers
Failures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our
fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center
capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we
continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data
center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to operate our networks effectively.
10
Table of Contents
In addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost
by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers
may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our
fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train,
and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.
Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity
of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to
properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to
accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment
network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.
We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An
inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties
experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related
costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory
efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including
public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or
trade disputes, and similar events.
We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive,
proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or
other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could:
expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result
in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network
security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our
business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation,
encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions.
Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our
operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or
financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such
incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer,
such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.
We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to
respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which
may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade
our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid
system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.
Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or
interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including
as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer
viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions.
Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and
fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us
to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance
may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be
expensive to remedy.
The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could
Negatively Affect Our Business
We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have “key
person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries
in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience
11
Table of Contents
significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.
In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our
employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability
to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully
transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.
We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out
our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our
operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations
applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our
operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.
We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational
efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our
response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.
Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of
supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content.
We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components,
or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or
licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or
more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public
health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers
in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, we rely on a limited group of suppliers for
semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units.
Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence
technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations,
contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as
unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our
operating results.
Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks
We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through
commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services,
technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through
our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource
commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop
the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory
management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform
services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume
of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may
be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative
commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we
provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.
As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may
in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual
obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:
• disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
• impairment of other relationships;
• variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and
• difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.
12
Table of Contents
Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint
ventures with additional companies. These transactions involve risks such as:
• disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
• problems retaining key personnel;
• additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
• the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;
• the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our
own customers as a result of any integration of operations;
• the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing
conditions, and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;
• the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses
related to such integration;
• the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security,
human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such
integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;
• losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s
financial performance into our financial results;
• for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in
part, or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the
dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;
• the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger
public company;
• the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks
our other businesses face;
• potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and
• for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages,
and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur
debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and
harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and
strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-
temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.
We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and
third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality,
new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and
consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to
accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products,
however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we
begin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships,
determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of
inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection
and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in
sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above
