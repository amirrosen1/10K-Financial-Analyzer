upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become
subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication
processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain
payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our
operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment
processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each
case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-
branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated.
We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules
governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.
Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent
fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines
and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic
funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with
us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf.
Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling,
and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject
to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money
transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic
fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements
and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.
We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile
We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to,
among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:
• changes in interest rates;
• conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;
• quarterly variations in operating results;
• fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;
• changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;
• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;
• changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;
• changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and
• transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.
Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash
compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce
the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.
