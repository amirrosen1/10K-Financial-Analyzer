upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become
subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication
processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain
payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our
operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment
processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each
case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-
branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated.
We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules
governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.
Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent
fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines
and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic
funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with
us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf.
Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling,
and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject
to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money
transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic
fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements
and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.
We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile
We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to,
among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:
• changes in interest rates;
• conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;
• quarterly variations in operating results;
• fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;
• changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;
• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;
• changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;
• changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and
• transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.
Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash
compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce
the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet,
physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence
technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy,
data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights,
distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption,
environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and
protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting
requirements, unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health,
safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial
operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how

existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization,
network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet, e-commerce, digital content, web
services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions
regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our
businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments
and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our
operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe
competition rules, including aspects of Amazon’s operation of its stores including its fulfillment network, Amazon’s acquisitions,
and certain aspects of AWS’s offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously
in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the
collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators
will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of
the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to be online “gatekeepers” through the application
of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws, which increases our compliance costs and limits the
operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities
applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could
cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial
monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require
us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or
otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to
increase, amplifies these risks.
Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of
Operations
As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are
regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings
by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property
matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust, privacy, data
use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and
services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), and other matters. The
number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as
our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments
and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging
price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state attorneys general and the Federal
Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our
operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves
judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters,
we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates
and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including
as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future
payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner
materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies,
damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.
We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture
Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or
illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell
products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may
reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales
grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain liability
insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to
be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to
prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for
