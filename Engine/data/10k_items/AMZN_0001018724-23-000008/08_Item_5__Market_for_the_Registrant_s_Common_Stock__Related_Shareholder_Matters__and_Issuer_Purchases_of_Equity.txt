mechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems, and other processes that are designed to prevent, detect, or mitigate data
loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data include
confidential, proprietary, and business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our business,
including on behalf of third parties. We also use systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a
third-party vendor or customer. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats
associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems we use for encryption and
authentication; employee email; content delivery to customers; back-office support; and other functions.
As part of our risk management process, we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration
testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments. We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are utilized when
incidents are detected. We require employees with access to information systems, including all corporate employees, to undertake
data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.
We have a unified and centrally-coordinated team, led by our chief security officer, that is responsible for implementing and
maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership and
other teams across Amazon. Reporting to our chief security officer are a number of experienced chief information security officers
responsible for various parts of our business, including AWS, each of whom is supported by a team of trained cybersecurity
professionals. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage assessors, consultants,
auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks.
Our cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership, including as part of our enterprise risk
assessments that are reviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Such risks and mitigations are also subject to
oversight by the Security Committee of our Board of Directors. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is
discussed in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” under the heading “We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security
Breaches,” which should be read in conjunction with the information above.
The Security Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees our policies and procedures for protecting
our cybersecurity infrastructure and for compliance with applicable data protection and security regulations, and related risks. The
Security Committee receives reports regarding such risks from management, including our chief security officer, and reports to the
Board at least annually. The Security Committee also oversees the Board’s response to any significant cybersecurity incidents.
Our chief security officer, who has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from over 15 years of work
experience on the security team at Amazon and an extensive career in the technology and cybersecurity industries as a senior
executive in the federal government, heads the team responsible for implementing and maintaining cybersecurity and data
protection practices at Amazon and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
