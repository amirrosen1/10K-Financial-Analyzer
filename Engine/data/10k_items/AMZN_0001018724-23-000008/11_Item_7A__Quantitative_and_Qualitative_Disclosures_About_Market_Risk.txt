reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP
cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2022 and 2023 (in millions):

All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and
do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do
not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions.
Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time.
Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements
of cash flows.
