Guidance
We provided guidance on February 1, 2024, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-
looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results
are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,
changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary
fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce,
cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”
First Quarter 2024 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.5 billion, or to grow between 8% and 13% compared with
first quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign exchange
rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $8.0 billion and $12.0 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in first quarter
2023. This guidance includes approximately $0.9 billion lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated
useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2024.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements
are concluded.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market
values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in
Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
Capital Resources.”
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-
term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements.
However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of
interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.
We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term
marketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected
due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due
to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities,
including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2023 (in
millions, except percentages):

As of December 31, 2023, we had long-term debt with a face value of $67.2 billion, including the current portion, primarily
consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 —
Debt” for additional information.

Table of Contents
Foreign Exchange Risk
During 2023, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related
expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North
America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros,
British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our
internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange
rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or
losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $88 million in
comparison with the prior year.
We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign
funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2023, of $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse
change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.2 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.7 billion.
We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the
intercompany balances as of December 31, 2023, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would
result in losses of $320 million, $640 million, and $1.3 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”
See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results
of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in
foreign exchange rates.
Equity Investment Risk
As of December 31, 2023, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and
private companies was $9.6 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our
equity investment in Rivian, represent $5.7 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023, and are recorded at fair value,
which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust
our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are
inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide
additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” for additional
information.

Amazon.com, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31,
2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of
As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income
the Matter
taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are
many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is
required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The
Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more
likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of
December 31, 2023, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $5.2 billion for various tax contingencies.
Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the
evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit
of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management’s evaluation
of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted by regulatory
changes and judicial and examination activity.
How We Addressed
We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies,
the Matter in Our
including controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; the
Audit
measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the development of
the related disclosures.
We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in
assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the
specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our
procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s
correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are
based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax
laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We
evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the
Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the appropriateness of
the Company’s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data used to determine the
amount of tax benefits to recognize. We evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures in relation to these
matters.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES
Description of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets,
consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers through
our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their
businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors, independent
publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve
developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including
compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In
addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored
ads, display, and video advertising.
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment
Information.”
Common Stock Split
On May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of
authorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout this
Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par
value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was
reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.”
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other assets” were
reclassified out of “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively,
the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which
we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller
lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment,
commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor
funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation
and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could
differ materially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2023 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing
the useful life from five years to six years in January 2024, which, based on servers that are included in “Property and equipment,
net” as of December 31, 2023, will have an anticipated impact to our 2024 operating income of $3.1 billion. We had previously
increased the useful life of our servers from four years to five years in January 2022.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $1.1 billion, of which $720 million was recorded in the
fourth quarter, of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These charges
were recorded in “Other operating expense (income), net” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our
North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded expenses of approximately $480 million,
primarily in “Fulfillment”, on our consolidated statements of operations primarily relating to terminating contracts for certain leases
not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment.
42
Table of Contents
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $720 million, of which $640 million was recorded in the
fourth quarter, of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in
“Technology and infrastructure,” “Fulfillment,” and “General and administrative” on our consolidated statements of operations and
primarily impacted our North America segment.
Charges for impairment, expenses for terminating contracts and other commitments, and severance costs were not material to
our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined
under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings
per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.
The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2021 2022 2023
Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 10,117 10,189 10,304
Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 179 — 188
Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 10,296 10,189 10,492
Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return
allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including
sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the
prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:
Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the
goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon
delivery, to the customer.
Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using
our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we
earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related
products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.
43
Table of Contents
Advertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs
such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or
impressions.
Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content
including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide
our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for
at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.
AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to
services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity
of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database,
are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in
connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.
Other - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video
content, health care services, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when
content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.
Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return
allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31,
2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were $5.1 billion, $5.5 billion, and $5.2 billion and deductions from the
allowance were $4.9 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.1 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated
balance sheets are assets totaling $882 million, $948 million, and $992 million as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, for the
rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including
costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs
where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in
our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction
costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of
operations.
Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions,
incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay
for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of
services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We
evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can
be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.
Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International
segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such as
depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking,
packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs
associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management
for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and
customer service operations.

Table of Contents
Technology and Infrastructure
Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and
development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display
of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers,
networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support
AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of
products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient
software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles
for ride-hailing services. Technology and infrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and
selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals
result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.
Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $16.9 billion,
$20.6 billion, and $20.3 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related
expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and
recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and
the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures,
using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the
first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of
sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, the adjustment to compensation expense
is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The estimated number of stock awards that will
ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such
amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when
estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level. Additionally, stock-
based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are
remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets, and asset impairments for
physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions):

Table of Contents
Included in other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(12.7)
billion and $797 million from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s preferred
stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public
offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31,
2023, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16% ownership interest, and an
approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our
equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and
one of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment
in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and
$3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting
in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.
Required summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions):

Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses
are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to
invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of
the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected
to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are
evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider
many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss
experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods
available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.
We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). The
first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely
than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to
measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We
consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments
and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our income tax contingencies
in income tax expense.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably
available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in
inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated
by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of
December 31, 2022 and 2023.
We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these
warrants had a fair value of $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets
with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are
classified as Level 2 and 3 assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are
valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available
information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or
liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-
down of inventory, was $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.
We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain
ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these
products are not included in our inventories.
We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide
manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and
help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device
components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These commitments are based
on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-
cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.
Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to
customers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, customer
receivables, net, were $26.6 billion and $34.1 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $6.9 billion and $8.5 billion, seller receivables,
net, were $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, and other receivables, net, were $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion. Seller receivables are amounts
due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. Prepaid
expenses and other current assets were $4.5 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.
We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables
are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance
with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.7 billion as of
December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were $1.0 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion, and deductions to
the allowance were $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Software Development Costs
We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use
software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs,
including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from
property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along
with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the
construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy
equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, four years prior to
January 1, 2022 and five years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our servers, five years prior to January 1, 2022 and six years
subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other
fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories
on our consolidated statements of operations.
Leases
We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are
generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under
finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases
generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.
Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of
property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are
accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone
prices.
Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a
discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value
of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments
reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the
lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.
When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the
leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification
and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices,
market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.
Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of
the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest
component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.
We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination
or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are
accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.
Financing Obligations
We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control
over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the
arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or
the term of the obligation.
If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are
derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs
or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to
evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its
carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived
intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an
impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future
cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category
expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.
We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as
of April 1, 2023, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.
There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired
Intangible Assets.”
Other Assets
Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net
of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity
warrant assets and certain equity investments; satellite network launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans. We
recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements,
such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are
recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.
Digital Video and Music Content
We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing
agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license
fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an
asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to
“Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee
is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also
develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an
accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of
our capitalized video content is 3.5 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video
content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.
Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major
geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs
or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is
primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $16.7 billion and $17.4 billion. Total video and
music expense was $16.6 billion and $18.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Total video and music expense
includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated
with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.
Investments
We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term
marketable debt securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value
below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted
recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated
statements of operations.
Convertible notes classified as available for sale, equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence and accounted for at cost, and equity investments accounted for using the equity method of
accounting are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.
49
Table of Contents
In Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. The note is classified as
available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).” The note is classified as a Level 3 asset. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75
billion in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services,
which includes the use of AWS chips.
Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted
for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in “Other income
(expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to
evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent
sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its
estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $715 million and $754 million.
Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option,
if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or
losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are
recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period,
we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment
to its estimated fair value.
Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value
option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes
recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would
necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change
in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying
amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based
on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain
criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its
immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.
Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and
asset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, current debt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, self-insurance
liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.7 billion and our liabilities for
unredeemed gift cards were $5.4 billion and $5.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The
portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.
Self-Insurance Liabilities
Although we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-
insure for exposure primarily related to workers’ compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability, and
automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance
liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, and
other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts,
associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth quarter
of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in
our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on our
consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment. Increases to our reserves driven by changes in
estimates were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and

2023. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our total self-insurance liabilities were $4.0 billion and $6.3 billion and are included in
“Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is
recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime
memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $16.1 billion, of which $12.4 billion was recognized as
revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $20.6 billion.
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.9 billion and $5.7 billion of unearned revenue
as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.
Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer
contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that
exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $155.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average
remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.0 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by
customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.
Other Long-Term Liabilities
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing
obligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax
liabilities.
Foreign Currency
We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly
incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that
either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our
consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we
recorded gains (losses) of $19 million, $386 million, and $(329) million in 2021, 2022, and 2023.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending
existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax
rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption
permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its
impact on our income tax disclosures.

Note 5 — ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
2021 Acquisition Activity
During 2021, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $496 million, net of cash acquired.
2022 Acquisition Activity
On March 17, 2022, we acquired MGM Holdings Inc., for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash
acquired, to provide more digital media content options for customers. We also assumed $2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid
immediately after closing. The acquired assets primarily consist of $3.4 billion of video content and $4.9 billion of goodwill.
During 2022, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $141 million, net of cash acquired.
2023 Acquisition Activity
On February 22, 2023, we acquired 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical), for cash consideration of approximately $3.5
billion, net of cash acquired, to provide health care options for customers. The acquired assets primarily consist of $1.3 billion of
intangible assets and $2.5 billion of goodwill, which is allocated to our North America segment.
During 2023, we also acquired certain other companies for an immaterial aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the 2023 acquisitions, individually and in the
aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were
not significant.
In addition, in August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation, as amended in July 2023, for
approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. In January 2024, we and iRobot agreed to
terminate the transaction.
Goodwill
The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and
functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible
assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax
purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2022 and 2023 by segment (in millions):

considered indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the research and development efforts. Once the research
and development efforts are completed, we determine the useful life and begin amortizing the assets.
Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangibles was $512 million, $604 million, and $706 million in 2021, 2022,

(1) The weighted-average remaining lives of the 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, April 2022, and December 2022 Notes were 11.6, 14.1,
17.5, 13.1, 12.3, and 4.9 years as of December 31, 2023. The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 12.7
years as of December 31, 2023.
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to
time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value
of the Notes was approximately $61.4 billion and $60.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, which is based on quoted prices
for our debt as of those dates.
We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we
may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until
August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to
0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $1.0 billion and $682 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of
December 31, 2022 and 2023, which had an interest rate of 5.6% and 6.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we
have pledged $1.2 billion and $806 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility.
The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of
December 31, 2022 and 2023.
As of December 31, 2023, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions):

In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan”),
maturing in January 2024 and bearing interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. The
Term Loan was classified as short-term debt and included within “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2023, the entire amount of the Term Loan has been repaid.
We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from
time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with
individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were $6.8 billion of
58
Table of Contents
borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2022, which were included in “Accrued
expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including issuance costs,
of 4.5%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2023. We use the net
proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.
In November 2023, we entered into a $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit
Agreement”), which replaced the prior amended and restated credit agreement entered into in March 2022. The Credit Agreement
has a term that extends to November 2028 and may be extended for one or more additional one-year terms if approved by the
lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified
in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement or the prior amended and restated credit agreement as of December 31, 2022
and 2023.
In November 2023, we also entered into a $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders
(the “Short-Term Credit Agreement”), which replaced the prior 364-day revolving credit agreement entered into in November 2022.
The Short-Term Credit Agreement matures in October 2024 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved
by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the
undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement or the prior 364-day revolving
credit agreement as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.
We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $1.2 billion and $147 million of
borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, which were included in “Accrued expenses and
other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $6.8 billion of unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2023.

financing obligations of $266 million and $271 million are recorded within “Accrued expenses and other” and $6.7 billion and
$6.6 billion are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. The weighted-average
remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.0 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was
3.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.
(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that
are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those
digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities
and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the
content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. Renewable energy
agreements based on actual generation without a fixed or minimum volume commitment are not included. These agreements
also provide the right to receive renewable energy certificates for no additional consideration.
(3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than
one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit
lease arrangements that are under construction. Excludes approximately $5.2 billion of income tax contingencies for which we
cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any.
Suppliers
During 2023, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or
arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit
limits.
Other Contingencies
We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various
non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we
already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically include (i) the taxability of products and
services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties,
including as a result of evolving requirements imposed on marketplaces with respect to third-party sellers, and (iii) the adequacy of
compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and
uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such
controversies may be materially different from our expectations.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:
In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on
www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed
60
Table of Contents
Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded
Objects Within a Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’
fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In
February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to
$130 million to $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California. In May 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding that the patent is invalid. In
June 2022, Eolas filed a notice of appeal. In February 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the
district court’s judgment. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc.
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa
Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using
Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced
damages, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in their damages report that
in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in damages. We dispute the
allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent
Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol”; and 7,233,978, entitled
“Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which the Location
Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest,
and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. In July 2023, Kove alleged in its damages report that in the
event of a finding of liability Amazon Web Services could be subject to $517 million to $1.03 billion in damages. We dispute the
allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
Beginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois (“N.D. Ill.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, including
Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other things, that Amazon’s collection, storage, use, retention, and
protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaints allege purported classes
of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including Amazon Photos, Alexa,
AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon’s Flex driver app, and Amazon’s virtual try-on technology. The complaints
seek certification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. We dispute
the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
Beginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Washington (“W.D. Wash.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other
things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon’s stores,
monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the
District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of
Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include
allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and
consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of
dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The
Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September 2023 in the W.D. Wash.
alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things,
that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those
monopolies through anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and
promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks injunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of
damages, and costs. Amazon’s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and
March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General’s lawsuit in March
2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims
alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC
Attorney General’s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is under appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to
defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
In October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon
Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things,
that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and 10,536,751, each
entitled “Video-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV
61
Table of Contents
Services Subscribers”; 10,028,026, entitled “System for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform of
a Digital TV Services Provider”; and 9,973,825, entitled “Dynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based on
Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of
damages. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be
subject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment, holding that the
patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will
continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon
Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection
Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of €746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision to
be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l.,
Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that
certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and
a fine of €1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. We believe the ICA’s
decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In July 2022, Acceleration Bay, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda,
Amazon Lumberyard, Luna, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, Amazon GameLift, GridMate, Amazon EKS, AWS App Mesh, and
Amazon VPC infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,701,344, entitled “Distributed Game Environment”; 6,714,966, entitled “Information
Delivery Service”; 6,732,147, entitled “Leaving a Broadcast Channel”; 6,829,634, entitled “Broadcasting Network”; and 6,910,069,
entitled “Joining a Broadcast Channel.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced
damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in
this matter.
In November 2022, LightGuide, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Nike Intent
Detection System used in certain fulfillment centers infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,515,981, entitled “Light Guided Assembly
System”; and 9,658,614 and 10,528,036, each entitled “Light Guided Assembly System and Method.” The complaint seeks an
unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations
of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In May 2023, Dialect, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District for Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Alexa-enabled
products and services, such as Echo devices, Fire tablets, Fire TV sticks, Fire TVs, Alexa, and Alexa Voice Services, infringe U.S.
Patent Nos. 7,693,720 and 9,031,845, each entitled “Mobile Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech
Utterance”; 8,015,006, entitled “Systems and Methods for Processing Natural Language Speech Utterances with Context-Specific
Domain Agents”; 8,140,327, entitled “System and Method for Filtering and Eliminating Noise from Natural Language Utterances
to Improve Speech Recognition and Parsing”; 8,195,468 and 9,495,957, each entitled “Mobile Systems and Methods of Supporting
Natural Language Human-Machine Interactions”; and 9,263,039, entitled “Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural
Language Speech Utterance.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs,
interest, and injunctive relief. In November 2023, the court granted in part Amazon’s motion to dismiss Dialect’s complaint and
dismissed the ‘845 patent from the case. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this
matter.
Beginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents
related to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India, the
United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International Trade
Commission. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video services and features of Amazon
devices carrying the Prime Video app infringe Nokia’s patents; some of the complaints additionally allege infringement by Freevee,
Twitch, and Amazon voice assistants. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and, in some cases, unspecified
money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These matters are at various procedural
stages, with preliminary injunctions issued in certain instances. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously in these matters.
In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings,
involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data
protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.

The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant
uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis,
developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess
of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and
disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such
an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could
potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates
and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could
have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Note 9 — INCOME TAXES
In 2021, 2022, and 2023, we recorded a net tax provision (benefit) of $4.8 billion, $(3.2) billion, and $7.1 billion. Our U.S.
taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and
development expenses. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $3.7 billion, $6.0 billion, and $11.2 billion for 2021, 2022,
and 2023.
Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those
earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by
allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out
annually from 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated depreciation deduction election for 2021,
and a full election for 2022 and 2023. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized
and amortized for U.S. tax purposes.

(1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits or shortfalls from stock-based compensation. Our
tax provision includes $1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2021, and $33 million and $519
million of tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation for 2022 and 2023.
(2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred
to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and is dependent on the amount of our U.S. taxable income.
We generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a decrease
in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction. This was partially offset by a reduction in excess tax benefits
from stock-based compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable
effects of corporate restructuring transactions. The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022 reflects a change in our
application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes a tax benefit of approximately
$655 million related to years prior to 2022.
