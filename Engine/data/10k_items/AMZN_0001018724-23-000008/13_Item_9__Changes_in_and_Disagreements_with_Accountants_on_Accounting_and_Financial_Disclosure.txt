Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Table of Contents
We recorded a provision for income taxes in 2023 as compared to an income tax benefit in 2022 primarily due to an increase
in pretax income, a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects of
corporate restructuring transactions, and an increase in tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by
an increase in federal research and development credits, which included approximately $600 million of tax benefit recorded in 2023
related to a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 U.S. federal R&D credit.
We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,
indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such
amounts.

___________________
(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.
(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign
taxing jurisdictions or future capital gains, as well as tax credits.
Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net
operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of
December 31, 2023 were approximately $10.2 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual
limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2024.
Income Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-
related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are
established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision
for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
