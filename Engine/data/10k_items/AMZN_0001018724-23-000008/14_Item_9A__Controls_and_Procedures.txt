Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Table of Contents
We recorded a provision for income taxes in 2023 as compared to an income tax benefit in 2022 primarily due to an increase
in pretax income, a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects of
corporate restructuring transactions, and an increase in tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by
an increase in federal research and development credits, which included approximately $600 million of tax benefit recorded in 2023
related to a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 U.S. federal R&D credit.
We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,
indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such
amounts.

___________________
(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.
(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign
taxing jurisdictions or future capital gains, as well as tax credits.
Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net
operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of
December 31, 2023 were approximately $10.2 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual
limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2024.
Income Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-
related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are
established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision
for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.

___________________
(1) As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $5.2 billion of income tax contingencies of which $3.3 billion, if fully
recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax
contingencies of $103 million and $194 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023 were $28 million, $(7) million, and $91 million.
We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and
thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating
losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.
We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India,
Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments
by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing
tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income.
In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed
from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We
believe the LTA’s position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes
paid.
The Indian tax authority (“ITA”) has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need
to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA’s
position is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this
matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.
In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax
authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union
rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities
in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision, the European Commission
announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014,
and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg
computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we deposited into escrow in
March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European
Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European
Commission’s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice.
In December 2023, the European Court of Justice affirmed the European Union General Court’s decision.
Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies.
Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory
processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts
ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is
reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly
reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes
to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly
depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible
outcomes.
