Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment
results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and
administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of
technology costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America and
AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are allocated to the AWS segment
based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker
(“CODM”) regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated operating income (loss) by
segment. Amounts included in consolidated operating expenses include “Cost of sales,” “Fulfillment,” “Technology and
infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” “General and administrative,” and “Other operating expense (income), net.” Our CODM
manages our business by reviewing annual forecasts and consolidated results by segment on a quarterly basis.
North America
The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and advertising and subscription services through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes
export sales from these online stores.
International
The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and advertising and subscription services through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales
from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico,
and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.
AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-
ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.
Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions):
