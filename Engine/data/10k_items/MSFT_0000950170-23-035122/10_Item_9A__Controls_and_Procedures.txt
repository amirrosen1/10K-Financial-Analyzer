Executive Incentive Plan
Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive
officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest ratably over a service period of four years.
PSUs generally vest over a performance period of three years. The number of shares the PSU holder
receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.
