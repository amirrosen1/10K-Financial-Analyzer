Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated
structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit
other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative
value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices
charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is
allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are
allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.
In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These
allocated costs generally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human
resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support,
and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on
the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross
margin or relative headcount.
