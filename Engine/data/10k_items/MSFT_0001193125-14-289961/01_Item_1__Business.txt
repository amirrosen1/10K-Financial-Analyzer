and product and solution support services, and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers.
We conduct research and develop advanced technologies for future software, devices, and services. We believe that we
will continue to grow and meet our customers’ needs as the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and
cloud-first world. We will continue to create new opportunities for partners, increase customer satisfaction, and improve
our service excellence, business efficacy, and internal processes.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a
devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for
purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we
reported our financial performance based on our new segments: Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Licensing, D&C
Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other.

Item 1
On April 25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and
Services Business (“NDS”). We report the financial performance of NDS in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the
acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C
Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the
acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C Hardware segment was renamed Computing
and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.
Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the
alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they
provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within
businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in
Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements.
Devices and Consumer
Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to increase personal
productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, entertain and connect people, and help
advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C segments are made up of D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming
Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other.
D&C Licensing
The principal products and services provided by the D&C Licensing segment are: Windows, including original equipment
manufacturer (“OEM”) licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the
Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office
product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and
certain other patent licensing revenue.
The Windows operating system is designed to empower individuals, companies, and organizations to simplify everyday
tasks through seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software.
Windows revenue growth is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by
OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is
impacted by:
• the mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size;
• differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets;
• attachment of Windows to devices shipped;
• customer mix between consumer, small and medium sized businesses, and large enterprises;
• changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel;
• pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from
local and regional system builders to large, multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions
licensed;
• piracy; and
• sales of packaged software.
The versions of Office included in our D&C Licensing segment are designed to increase personal productivity through a
range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set
and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as content management and collaboration. Office
Consumer revenue is impacted by sales to customers that buy Office with their new devices and by product launches, as
well as the transition to Office 365 Consumer, our subscription-based cloud service that provides access to Office plus
other productivity services. Office 365 Consumer revenue is included in our D&C Other segment.

Item 1
The Windows Phone operating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they
need. As noted above, prior to our acquisition of NDS, Microsoft and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and
services and extended established products and services to new markets through a strategic alliance. Windows Phone
revenue associated with this contractual relationship was reflected in D&C Licensing. Windows Phone revenue also
includes revenue from licensing mobile-related patents.
Competition
The Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and
devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value,
flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications,
including those that enable productivity, and the largest support network for any operating system.
Competitors to the versions of Office included in D&C Licensing include global application vendors such as Apple and
Google, numerous web-based competitors, and local application developers in Asia and Europe. Apple distributes
versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email, note taking, and calendar products, through its PCs,
tablets, and phones. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite and distributes its productivity services
through the Android and Chrome operating systems. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications can also
position themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of
providing powerful, flexible, secure, and easy to use solutions that work across a variety of devices.
Windows Phone operating system faces competition from iOS, Android, and Blackberry operating systems. Windows
Phone competes based on differentiated user interface, personalized applications, compatibility with Windows PCs and
tablets, and other unique capabilities.
Computing and Gaming Hardware
The principal products and services provided by the Computing and Gaming Hardware segment are: Xbox gaming and
entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions
(“Xbox Platform”); Surface devices and accessories; and Microsoft PC accessories.
The Xbox Platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment choices through the use of our devices,
peripherals, content, and online services. We released Xbox 360 and Xbox One in November 2005 and November 2013,
respectively.
Surface devices are designed to help organizations, students, and consumers to be more productive, offering accessories
and compatibility with peripherals. Surface devices were first released in October 2012. Our latest Surface device, the
Surface Pro 3, was released in June 2014.
Competition
Our Xbox Platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established
base of customers. The lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released
their latest generation console in November 2012. Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013.
We believe the success of gaming and entertainment consoles is determined by the availability of games for the console,
providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the console, and the ability
to create new experiences via online services, downloadable content, and peripherals. In addition to Sony and Nintendo,
we compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces. We believe the Xbox Platform is
effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture,
user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from
our own game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.

non-Lumia phones, which we began manufacturing and selling with the acquisition of NDS on April 25, 2014.
Competition
Our phones face competition primarily from Samsung and Apple, as well as many other mobile device manufacturers. We
believe our phones will compete by being tailored for virtually every demographic and geography worldwide, offering
unique industrial design and imaging technologies at high and low ranges of price points, and by incorporating Microsoft’s
digital work and digital life experiences.
D&C Other
The principal products and services provided by the D&C Other segment are: Resale, including the Windows Store, Xbox
Live transactions, and the Windows Phone Store; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer,
comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; and our retail stores.
Windows Store and Windows Phone Store are online application marketplaces that are designed to benefit our developers
and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base and benefit users by providing centralized access
to certified applications. Xbox Live transactions consist of online entertainment content, such as games, music, movies,
and TV shows, accessible on Xbox consoles and other devices.
Search and display advertising includes Bing, Bing Ads, MSN, Windows Services, and Xbox ads. We are the exclusive
algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! websites worldwide. We have completed the Yahoo! worldwide algorithmic
transition and the paid search transition in the U.S. and planned international markets.
Office 365 Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of Microsoft Office programs and
services delivered across multiple platforms via the cloud.
Studios designs and markets games for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and online. Growth depends on our
ability to attract new users and increase engagement by developing a deep library of content which consumers seek.
Competition
We face competition for our Resale products and services from various online marketplaces, including those operated by
Amazon, Apple, and Google.
Our search and display advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like
Facebook, and portals like Yahoo! that provide content and online offerings to end users. Our success depends on our
ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. We believe
we can attract new users by continuing to offer new and compelling products and services. We differentiate our offerings
by providing a broad selection of content that helps users make faster, informed decisions, and take action more quickly
by providing relevant search results, expanded search services, and deeply-integrated social recommendations.
Competitors to Office 365 Consumer are the same as those discussed above for Office Consumer.

as game studios like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.
Commercial
Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and
organization productivity and efficiency, and to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user’s
hardware and software. Commercial is made up of the Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other segments.
Commercial Licensing
The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Licensing segment are: server products, including
Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CAL”);
Windows Embedded; volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic (“Windows Commercial”);
Microsoft Office for business, including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CAL (“Office Commercial”);
Skype; and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online.
Our server products are designed to make information technology professionals and developers and their systems more
productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software
applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business
intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and
identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers,
testers, and project managers. Revenue comes from product revenue, including purchases through volume licensing
programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged product. CAL provide access rights to certain server and Office
products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync. CAL revenue is reported
along with the associated server or Office product.
Windows Embedded extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems, including the Internet of Things,
by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services.
Windows Commercial revenue is mainly affected by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and
software assurance, often reflecting the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively
independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.
The versions of Office in Commercial Licensing are designed to increase personal, team and organizational productivity
through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a
combination of the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and software assurance and the number of
information workers in a licensed enterprise, and is therefore relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given
year.
Skype is designed to connect friends, family, clients, and colleagues through a variety of devices. Revenue is largely
driven by the sale of minutes, subscriptions, and advertising.
Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management,
supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and
divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number of information workers licensed.
Competition
Our server operating system products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications
offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-
Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on

server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many
contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large
number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A
number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.
We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software
vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and
intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the
Java Platform Enterprise Edition that compete with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for
our server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle.
Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In
middleware, we compete against Java middleware such as Geronimo, Wildfly, and Spring Framework.
Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as
BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing
solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our products for software
developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, other companies, and open-source projects, including
Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails, among others.
Our embedded systems compete in a highly fragmented environment in which key competitors include IBM, Intel, and
versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors such as Metrowerks and MontaVista Software.
We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and
productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and
software applications, security, and manageability.
Competitors to Windows Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Windows in the D&C Licensing segment.
Office Commercial revenue growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set and to continue to expand
our product offerings in other areas such as content management, enterprise search, collaboration, unified
communications, and business intelligence. Competitors to Office Commercial includes software application vendors such
as Adobe Systems, Apple, Cisco Systems, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and numerous web-based competitors as well as
local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications
equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Web-
based offerings competing with individual applications can also position themselves as alternatives to our products. We
believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing powerful, flexible, secure, easy to use
solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have and are available on a device or via the cloud.
Skype competes with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to
established enterprises.
Our Microsoft Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Oracle and SAP in the market for large organizations and
divisions of global enterprises. In the market focused on providing solutions for small and mid-sized businesses, our
Microsoft Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Infor, The Sage Group, and NetSuite. Salesforce.com’s cloud
CRM offerings compete directly with Microsoft Dynamics CRM on-premises offerings.
Commercial Other
The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Other segment are: Enterprise Services, including
Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365
Commercial, other Microsoft Office online offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure.

Office 365 Commercial is an online services offering that includes Microsoft Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync, and
is available across a variety of devices and platforms.
Dynamics CRM Online is designed to provide customer relationship management and supply chain management for small
and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Revenue is largely driven by the number
of information workers licensed.
Microsoft Azure is a scalable operating system with computing, storage, database, and management, along with
comprehensive cloud solutions, from which customers can build, deploy, and manage enterprise workloads and web
applications. These services also include a platform that helps developers build and connect applications and services in
the cloud. Our goal is to enable customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit
their businesses, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software.
Competition
The Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning,
application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses
focused on specific technologies.
Competitors to Office 365 Commercial are the same as those discussed above for Office Commercial.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM’s online offerings primarily compete with Salesforce.com’s on-demand CRM offerings.
Microsoft Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com,
VMware, and other open source offerings.
OPERATIONS
We have operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing,
credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland
supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater
China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond,
Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also
operate data centers throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia regions.
To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international
markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require
modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.
Our Xbox consoles and games, Surface devices, and Microsoft PC accessories are manufactured by third party contract
manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable or
unable to meet our requirements.
With the acquisition of NDS, we now operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones in
Brazil, China, Hungary, Mexico, and Vietnam.
All our devices may include key components that are available from only one or limited sources. Disruption of component
supply from these suppliers could potentially lead to a disruption of production of certain devices.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
During fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, research and development expense was $11.4 billion, $10.4 billion, and
$9.8 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 13% of revenue in each of those years. We plan to continue to make
significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts.
Product and Service Development and Intellectual Property
We develop most of our products and services internally through four primary engineering groups.
• Applications and Services Engineering Group, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in
productivity, communication, search, and other information categories.
• Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group, focuses on development of Microsoft’s back-end technologies like
datacenter, database, and our specific technologies for enterprise IT scenarios and development tools. This
group also engineers datacenter development, construction, and operation.
• Devices Engineering Group, focuses on all hardware development and supply chain, including Xbox consoles,
Surface devices, Lumia Smartphones, other non-Lumia phones, Perceptive Pixel products, and accessories.
• Operating Systems Engineering Group, focuses on Microsoft’s operating systems for consoles, mobile devices,
PCs, and back-end systems. Studios and Universal Store, the core cloud services for marketplaces,
membership, and commerce platform, are also in this group.
Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer
technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and
enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as
possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new
software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training,
and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally.
We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to
ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and
hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing
patents and currently have a portfolio of over 55,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 40,000 pending. While
we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also
engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or
Microsoft’s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies
covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or
services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective,
such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development
community. In conjunction with the NDS acquisition, we received an initial 10-year non-exclusive license to certain Nokia
patents. We also agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and granted Nokia reciprocal rights to use our patents for
their mapping and location services.
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business
methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on
commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially
dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.
Investing in the Future
Microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our
users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive
broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and
10
Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1
breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company.
We maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and
platforms spanning communication and collaboration, information access and organization, entertainment, business and
e-commerce, advertising, and devices.
While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and
development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain
competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund
research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities
further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our
business segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the
company.
In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is
one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities
around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future
technology trends and contributing to our product and service innovation.
Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development, we see
significant opportunities to drive future growth in productivity, platforms, cloud computing, search, communications, and
smart connected devices.
DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING
We market and distribute our products and services primarily through the following channels: OEMs; distributors and
resellers; online; and Microsoft retail stores.
OEMs
We distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new PCs, tablets, servers, smartphones, and other
intelligent devices that they sell to end customers. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating
system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including
server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In addition to these products,
we also market our services through OEMs and service bundles such as Windows with Bing or Windows with Office 365
subscription.
There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest OEMs, many of which operate globally, are referred to as “Direct
OEMs,” as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have
distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the multinational OEMs, including Acer,
ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HTC, Hewlett-Packard, LG, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony, Toshiba, and with many regional and local
OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs consists of lower-volume PC manufacturers (also called “system builders”),
which source their Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor
channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.
Distributors and Resellers
Many organizations that license our products and services through enterprise agreements transact directly with us, with
sales support from solution integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and developers that advise
organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Direct Advisors”, or “EDAs”). Organizations
also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through license solutions partners (“LSPs”), distributors, value-
added resellers (“VARs”), OEMs, system builder channels, and retailers. Although each type of
11
Table of Contents
PART I
Item 1
reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell
primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small-sized and medium-sized organizations. EDAs typically are also
authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs, such as the Select Plus and Open licensing
programs discussed under “Licensing Options” below. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and
some of our largest resellers include CDW, Dell, Insight Enterprises, and Software House International.
Our Microsoft Dynamics software offerings are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners
providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through
independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain
these products primarily through retail outlets, such as Wal-Mart, Dixons, and Microsoft retail stores. We distribute our
hardware products, including Surface, Xbox, phones, and PC accessories, through third-party retailers and Microsoft retail
stores. Our phones are also distributed through global wireless communications carriers. We have a network of field sales
representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers, and provides product
training and sales support.
Online
Although on-premises software will continue to be an important part of our business, increasingly we are delivering
additional value to customers through cloud-based services. We provide online content and services to consumers
through Bing, MSN portals and channels, Office 365, Windows Phone Store, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, Skype, and
Windows Store. We also provide commercial cloud-based services such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft
Azure, and Office 365 consisting of online versions of Microsoft Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and Yammer. Other
services delivered online include our online advertising platform with offerings for advertisers and publishers, as well as
Microsoft Developer Network subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and
practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions. As we
increasingly deliver online services, we sell many of these cloud-based services through our enterprise agreements and
have also enabled new sales programs to reach small and medium-sized businesses. These new programs include direct
sales, direct sales supported by a large network of partner advisors, and resell of services through operator channels,
such as telephone, cell, and cable providers.
We also sell our products through our Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces.
LICENSING OPTIONS
We license software to organizations under agreements that allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products
and services. Our agreements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products and services are designed to
provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. In delivering
organizational licensing agreements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for
organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those
discussed below.
Customer Licensing Programs
Open Licensing
Designed primarily for small-to-medium organizations, Open Programs allows customers to acquire perpetual or
subscription licenses and, at the customer’s election, rights to future versions of software products over a specified time
period (two or three years depending on the Open Programs used). The offering that conveys rights to future versions of
certain software products over the contract period is called software assurance. Software assurance also provides
support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Open Programs has several variations to
fit customers’ diverse way of purchasing. Under the Open Program, customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with
software assurance. They can also renew software assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing
agreements. Office 365 is also available for purchase through the Open Program.

Select Plus Licensing
Designed primarily for medium-to-large organizations, the Select Plus Program allows customers to acquire perpetual
licenses and, at the customer’s election, software assurance over a specified time period (generally three years or less).

agreements for a specified time period (generally three years). Online Services are also available for purchase through the
enterprise agreement and subscriptions are generally structured with three year terms.
