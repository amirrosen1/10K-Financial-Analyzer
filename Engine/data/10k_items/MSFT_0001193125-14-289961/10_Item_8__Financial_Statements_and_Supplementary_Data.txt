NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant
influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities are accounted
for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee
and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the
fair value of, and/or potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible
and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory;
and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software
arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological
feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are
other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.
Recasting of Certain Prior Period Information
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a
devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for
purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we
reported our financial performance based on our new segments described in Note 21 – Segment Information and
Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and
monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. This change impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 14 – Unearned
Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on our consolidated financial
statements.
Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
58
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether
elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where
elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the
respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized
as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to
elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of
selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the
use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the
price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before
introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the
deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and
considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable.
Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual
licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.
Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or
significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the
product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue
allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair
value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by
management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the
near future at the price set by management.
Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they
meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred
and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is
being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the
arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates
are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made
available.
Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive
unspecified future versions of software products (“Software Assurance”), which we have determined are additional
software products and are therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and
recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current
products with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted
for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.
Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a
contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with
billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date
the service is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a
consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the
customer utilization of such resources.
Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings
that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However,
because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they
have the same revenue recognition timing.

Item 8
Revenue related to phones, Surface, Xbox consoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally
recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail
stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software
elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles
is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.
Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized
when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed.
Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the
consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services
arrangements is recognized as services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of
software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs
related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold
by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space (“traffic acquisition costs”); costs incurred
to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs;
inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of
capitalized research and development costs. Capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the
estimated lives of the products.
Product Warranty
We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the
related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product
failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific
hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business,
but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties,
we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly
reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include
third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets,
and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are
included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our
software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,
trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $2.3
billion, $2.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

PART II
Item 8
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as
expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four
to five years) using the straight-line method.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of
the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is
measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of
such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The deferred income taxes are classified as
current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value
measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. These levels are:
• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our
Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international
equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively
traded on exchanges.
• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the
Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models
project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable
inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for
currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and
bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, and foreign
government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option
and swap contracts.
• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using
model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-
derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock and goodwill when it is
recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to
the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when
they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined
61
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market
comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.
Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying
values.
Financial Instruments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to
be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with
original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid
nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments,
are reflected in OCI.
Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. With the exception of
certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the
market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Held-to-
maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other investments that
are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be
carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned
securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower.
Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is
calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a
systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating
potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value
is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income
securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required
to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and
business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and
financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is
recorded to other income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of
change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options
designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
are recognized in earnings.
For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is
initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged
62
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing
either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
earnings.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily
recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as
commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying
available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-
temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”)
into other income (expense).
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable
balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

Write-offs (51) (57) (59)
Balance, end of period $ 301 $ 336 $ 389
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and
manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on
hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a
reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.
The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis
require significant judgment.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as
follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three
years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 20 years; and furniture and
equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment)
on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically
by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset
may be impaired.

Recent Accounting Guidance
Recently adopted accounting guidance
In December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance enhancing disclosure
requirements about the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial
instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in
accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that
the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending arrangements that are
either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. We adopted this new
guidance beginning July 1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of Note 5 –
Derivatives.
In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of AOCI. This new
guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to financial statements)
the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of AOCI. We adopted this new guidance
beginning July 1, 2013. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to the presentation of Note 19 –
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted
In March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on a parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon
derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that the parent release
any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or
substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The new
guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2014. We do not anticipate material impacts on our consolidated
financial statements upon adoption.
In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, recognition of
revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard
requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. We
anticipate this standard will have a material impact, and we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on
our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common
stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include
reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our
derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional
amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.
Foreign Currency
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and
forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and
are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, and Canadian dollar. As of June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange
contracts sold were $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, the total
notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $3.1 billion and $407 million, respectively.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in exchange
rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of
June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and
$8.5 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased
and sold were $5.0 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively.
Equity
Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed
relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options,
futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may
use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of June 30,
2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $3.1 billion
and $2.1 billion, respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as hedging
instruments. As of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market
price risk were $898 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, none of which were designated as hedging instruments.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We
manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-
based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of fixed-
interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $503 million and $741 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the total
notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $809 million, respectively.
In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to
agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery
of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2014 and 2013, the total notional derivative
amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

PART II
Item 8
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to
facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing exposure to
individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of credit contracts
purchased and sold were $412 million and $440 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of
credit contracts purchased and sold were $377 million and $501 million, respectively.
Commodity
We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use
swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to
broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase
and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of June 30,
2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $408 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.2 billion
and $249 million, respectively.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the
standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2014, our long-term unsecured debt rating was
AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

We estimate that $32 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2014 will be reclassified into earnings
within the following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a
result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2014.
Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses)
Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in
other income (expense). These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on derivatives
presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the periods

NOTE 9 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Nokia’s Devices and Services Business
On April 25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all of NDS for a total purchase price of $9.5
billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (“the Acquisition”). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash of $7.1
billion and Nokia’s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion which was a non-cash transaction. The Acquisition is
expected to accelerate the growth of our Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) business through faster innovation, synergies,
and unified branding and marketing.
The purchase price allocation as of the date of the Acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to
revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed become available.
The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows:
(In millions)
Cash $ 1,503
Accounts receivable (a) 754
Inventories 544
Other current assets 960
Property and equipment 981
Intangible assets 4,509
Goodwill (b) 5,458
Other 249
Current liabilities (4,576)
Long-term liabilities (917)
Total purchase price $ 9,465
(a) Gross accounts receivable is $901 million, of which $147 million is expected to be uncollectible.
(b) Goodwill was assigned to our new Phone Hardware segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased
synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of NDS. Goodwill of $4.5 billion is expected to be
deductible in Finland for tax purposes.
Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:

Fair value of intangible assets acquired $ 4,509 8 years
Our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 includes revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692
million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.

Following are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the
Acquisition had been consummated on July 1, 2012:

Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013
Revenue $ 96,248 $ 93,243
Net income $ 20,234 $ 20,153
Diluted earnings per share $ 2.41 $ 2.38
These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the
results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments
primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft
and NDS. Acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of
NDS. Acquisition costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance,
consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in Integration and restructuring costs on our
consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014.
Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint
strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or
loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition, we agreed
to license Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as
they are rendered.
Yammer
On July 18, 2012, we acquired Yammer, Inc. (“Yammer”), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion
in cash. Yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to
Microsoft’s portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. The major classes of assets to which we allocated the
purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. We assigned the goodwill to
Commercial Other under our current segment structure. Yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting
on the acquisition date.
Skype
On October 13, 2011, we acquired Skype Global S.á r.l. (“Skype”), a leading global provider of software applications and
related Internet communications products based in Luxembourg, for $8.6 billion, primarily in cash. The major classes of
assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $7.1 billion, identifiable intangible assets of
$1.6 billion, and unearned revenue of $222 million. The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily
attributable to our expectation of extending Skype’s brand and the reach of its networked platform, while enhancing
Microsoft’s existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services. We assigned the goodwill to the following
segments under our current segment structure: $5.6 billion to Commercial Licensing, $1.4 billion to Computing and
Gaming Hardware, and $54 million to D&C Other. Skype was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the
acquisition date.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are presented as “Other” in the above
table. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between business segments due to reorganizations,
as applicable.
As discussed in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we
changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. This resulted in a
change in our operating segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair
value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units
immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.
Goodwill Impairment
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology
with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is
the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.
No impairment of goodwill was identified as of May 1, 2014 or May 1, 2013. Upon completion of the fiscal year 2012 test,
the goodwill of our OSD unit (in Devices and Consumer Other under our current segment structure) was determined to be
impaired. The impairment was the result of the OSD unit experiencing slower than projected growth in search queries and
search advertising revenue per query, slower growth in display revenue, and changes in the timing and implementation of
certain initiatives designed to drive search and display revenue growth in the future. This goodwill impairment charge of
$6.2 billion also represented our accumulated goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2014 and 2013.

Short-term Debt
As of June 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest
rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 days to 91 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper
approximates its carrying value.
We have a $5.0 billion credit facility that expires on November 14, 2018, which serves as a back-up for our commercial
paper program. As of June 30, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement,
which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement. No amounts were drawn against the credit facility
during any of the periods presented.
Long-term Debt
As of June 30, 2014, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $20.6 billion and $21.5
billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the
current portion, of $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2013. These estimated fair values are based

Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, were $8.7 billion, $8.6 billion, and $7.2 billion,

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to
2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain
under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the
audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could
have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do
not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not
anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also
continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2013.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject
to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions
of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain
other software products between 1999 and 2005.
We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the United States. Under the settlements, generally
class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral
computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to
certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-

thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class
members who make claims and are issued vouchers. We estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is
approximately $400 million, all of which had been accrued as of June 30, 2014.
Three similar cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been settled. In March 2010, the
court in the British Columbia case certified it as a class action. The plaintiffs successfully appealed a British Columbia
Court of Appeal decision reversing class certification and dismissing the case. In October 2013, the Canadian Supreme
Court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the British Columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in
September 2015. The other two cases were inactive pending action by the Supreme Court on the British Columbia case.
Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims
Novell litigation
In November 2004, Novell, Inc. (“Novell”) filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the District of Utah (later transferred to
federal court in Maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell’s ownership of
WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. After the trial court
dismissed or granted summary judgment on a number of Novell’s claims, trial of the one remaining claim took place in late
2011 and resulted in a mistrial. In July 2012, the trial court granted Microsoft’s motion for judgment as a matter of law.
Novell appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed the trial court’s decision in
September 2013. The Supreme Court denied Novell’s petition for review in April 2014.
Go Computer litigation
In June 2005, GO Computer Inc. and co-founder Jerry Kaplan filed a complaint in California state court asserting antitrust
claims under the Cartwright Act related to the business of the former GO Corporation in the early 1990s and its successor
in interest, Lucent Corporation in the early 2000s. All claims prior to June 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as
barred by the statute of limitations. After a mini-trial on standing issues, the case is now moving forward with discovery,
and a trial is set for September 2015.
China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation
On July 28, 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) had begun
a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft
offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle
sales, and file verification issues related to Windows and Office software.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
Motorola litigation
In October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola Mobility (“Motorola”) with the International
Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by Motorola’s
Android devices. Since then, Microsoft and Motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the ITC, in federal
district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany and the United Kingdom. The nature
of the claims asserted and status of individual matters are summarized below.
International Trade Commission
In May 2012, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order against Motorola on one Microsoft patent, which became effective in
July 2012 and was affirmed on appeal in December 2013. In July 2013, Microsoft filed an action in U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the ITC’s May 2012 import ban against infringing Motorola
products by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), after learning that CBP had failed to fully enforce the
order.

PART II
Item 8
In November 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft with the ITC alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by
Xbox consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing Xbox
products. At Motorola’s request, the ITC terminated its investigation of four Motorola patents. In March 2013, the ITC
affirmed there was no violation of the remaining Motorola patent. Motorola appealed the ITC’s decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
U.S. District Court
The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to Microsoft’s ITC case against
Motorola was stayed pending the outcome of the ITC case.
In November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola
breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and
non-discriminatory (“RAND”) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of
the H.264 video standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In the Motorola ITC case described above and in suits described
below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U.S. District Courts, in the ITC,
and in Germany. In February 2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft
ruling that (1) Motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on RAND terms
and conditions; and (2) Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the Seattle District Court set
per unit royalties for Motorola’s H.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial Microsoft liability. In September
2013, following trial of Microsoft’s breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to Microsoft. Motorola
appealed.
Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one currently stayed case in Wisconsin
(a companion case to Motorola’s ITC action), have been transferred to the U.S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and
Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. The court has stayed these cases on agreement of the parties.
• In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by a range of Microsoft products including
mobile and PC operating system, productivity, server, communication, browser and gaming products.
• In the Motorola action originally filed in California, Motorola asserts Microsoft violated antitrust laws in connection
with Microsoft’s assertion of patents against Motorola that Microsoft agreed to license to certain qualifying
entities on RAND terms and conditions.
• In counterclaims, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola
digital video recorders.
Germany
In July 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries.
• Motorola asserts two patents (one now expired) are essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard,
and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet
Explorer infringe those patents. In May 2012, the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable
Microsoft products in Germany, which Microsoft appealed. Orders in the litigation pending in Seattle, Washington
described above enjoin Motorola from enforcing the German injunction.
• Motorola asserts that one patent covers certain syncing functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by
Windows Phone 7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. In
April 2013, the court stayed the case pending the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft is seeking
to invalidate the patent. In November 2013, the Federal Patent Court invalidated the originally issued patent
claims, but ruled that certain new amended claims were patentable. Both Motorola and Microsoft appealed. In
June 2014, the court reopened infringement proceedings and scheduled a hearing in November 2014.
• Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any injunction by altering its products to avoid
Motorola’s infringement claims.
• Any damages would be determined in separate proceedings.

PART II
Item 8
In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft asserts that Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft
patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in Germany issued injunctions on three of the
Microsoft patents, which Motorola appealed. One judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and Motorola has further
appealed), and the other two appeals are pending. In actions filed separately by Motorola to invalidate these patents, the
Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014 held the Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft appealed. For the cases in which
Microsoft obtained injunctions, if Motorola were to prevail following all appeals, Motorola could have a claim against
Microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction.
United Kingdom
In December 2011, Microsoft filed an action against Motorola in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents
Court, in London, England, seeking to revoke the UK part of the European patent asserted by Motorola in Germany
against the ActiveSync protocol. In February 2012, Motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and
seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2012, the court ruled that Motorola’s patent is invalid. The court also
ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in Google’s ActiveSync license.
Motorola appealed and the appeals court affirmed the lower court’s ruling in Microsoft’s favor in November 2013. Motorola
has exhausted all appeals and the rulings in Microsoft’s favor are final.
IPCom patent litigation
IPCom GmbH & Co. is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology related patents spanning
about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents
in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. Three of the infringement suits
against Nokia (now assumed by Microsoft through the NDS acquisition) are still pending in courts in Germany, England,
and Italy. These courts have held a number of IPCom’s patents were invalid or not infringed. We continue to contest the
validity or infringement of the patents remaining in dispute.
Interdigital patent litigation
InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed four patent
infringement cases against Nokia in the ITC and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013.
We are being substituted for Nokia in these cases. Each case includes other co-defendants because most of the patents
at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The suite of cases
include three ITC investigations where IDT is seeking an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S.
and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages.
European copyright levies
We have assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in various
European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are
based upon a 2001 EU Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or
private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate
copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating
that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory
for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are
pending in Germany and Austria, due to both high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. We
are litigating against certain collecting societies on the basis that the levy schemes exceed what the EU Directive and
European Court of Justice decisions permit.
Other patent and intellectual property claims
In addition to these cases, there are approximately 90 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft.

Item 8
Product-Related Litigation
U.S. cell phone litigation
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior
Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused
their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS
acquisition. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining ten
cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health
effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission
radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their
handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect.
The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In
September 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation
on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. The motion was heard in December 2013 and January 2014. In March
2014, defendants filed a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs’ general causation testimony on the ground that it is pre-
empted by federal law because the experts challenge the safety of all cellular handsets, including those that comply with
the FCC Guidelines. Both motions are pending.
Canadian cell phone class action
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in
the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1600
hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014. The
litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.
Other
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our
business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of June 30, 2014, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $780 million in other current liabilities and $81 million in other
long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. While we intend to defend these
matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $2.0 billion in aggregate beyond
recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a
material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably
estimable. Substantially all changes from the prior quarter in these accruals and estimates are attributable to matters
involving Nokia that we assumed as a result of the NDS acquisition.

Savings Plan
We have a savings plan in the U.S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of
savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 75% of their salary, but not
more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with
a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the given
year. Matching contributions for all plans were $420 million, $393 million, and $373 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and
2012, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each
participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan
include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in
Microsoft common stock.
NOTE 21 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company’s Chief
Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared
on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segment information in this note is reported on that basis.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a
devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for
purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we
reported our financial performance based on our new segments; D&C Licensing, D&C Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial
Licensing, and Commercial Other. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally
managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014.
On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note 9 – Business Combinations for additional details. NDS
has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. We report the financial
performance of the acquired business in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial
results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The
contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the
creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming
Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.
Our reportable segments are described below.

Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Devices and Consumer
Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect
people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help
advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C segments are:
• D&C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume
licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume
licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”);
Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue;
• Computing and Gaming Hardware, comprising: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories,
second-party and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions (“Xbox Platform”); Surface
devices and accessories; and Microsoft PC accessories;
• Phone Hardware, comprising: Lumia Smartphones and other non-Lumia phones, beginning with the acquisition
of NDS; and
• D&C Other, comprising: Resale, including Windows Store, Xbox Live transactions, and Windows Phone Store;
search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365
Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; our retail stores; and certain other consumer products
and services not included in the categories above.
Commercial
Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and
organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the
user’s hardware and software. Our Commercial segments are:
• Commercial Licensing, comprising: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual
Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); Windows Embedded; volume licensing of
the Windows operating system, excluding academic (“Windows Commercial”); Microsoft Office for business,
including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CALs (“Office Commercial”); Microsoft Dynamics
business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; and Skype; and
• Commercial Other, comprising: Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft
Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, other Microsoft Office online
offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure; and certain other commercial products and online
services not included in the categories above.
Revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. Certain revenue contracts are allocated
among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. Cost of revenue is directly
charged to our hardware segments. For the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and
allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology.
We do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, Devices
and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are made in
certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by
the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises
or in the cloud.
Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows:
• Sales and marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified
customer segment.
• Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross
margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment
group.
