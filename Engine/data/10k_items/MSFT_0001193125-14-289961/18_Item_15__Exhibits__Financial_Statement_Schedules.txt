REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation
Redmond, Washington
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated July 31, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for
preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets
are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not
intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Our assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
did not include the internal controls of Nokia Corporation’s Devices and Services business, acquired on April 25, 2014,
which is included in our 2014 consolidated financial statements and represented approximately 9% of our total assets as
of June 30, 2014, and 2% of our total revenues for the year ended June 30, 2014. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2014. There were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP
has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2014; their report is included in Item 9A.

Item 9A
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation
Redmond, Washington
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
of June 30, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in the Report of Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial
reporting at Nokia Corporation’s Devices and Services business, acquired on April 25, 2014 and whose financial
statements constitute 9% of total assets as of June 30, 2014 and 2% of total revenues for the year ended June 30, 2014.
Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Nokia Corporation’s Devices and
Services business. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
June 30, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2014, of the Company and our report
dated July 31, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
