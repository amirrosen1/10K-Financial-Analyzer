ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of
operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in
conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.
OVERVIEW
Microsoft is a technology leader focused on building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first,
cloud-first world. We strive to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We develop
and market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to
people’s lives.
We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of
services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices
that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most
significant expenses are related to compensating employees, designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our
products and services, datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services, and income taxes.
Much of our focus in fiscal year 2015 was toward transforming our organization to support our strategy of building best-in-
class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We achieved product development
milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support the three central
ambitions that support our strategy: reinventing productivity and business processes; building the intelligent cloud
platform; and creating more personal computing.
Highlights from fiscal year 2015 included:
• Momentum continued to grow in our Commercial Cloud and productivity offerings as we surpassed an $8 billion
annualized run rate* at the end of the year.
• Office 365 Commercial seats grew 74%, and Office 365 is now deployed in four out of five Fortune 500
enterprises, with more than half of that install base using premium workloads. We also added over 50,000 small-
and medium-sized business customers each month.
• Server products and services revenue increased 9%, driven by growth across our cloud and on-premises server
products. Azure revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits in the fourth quarter year over year, and
we ended fiscal year 2015 with more than 17,000 Enterprise Mobility Services customers.
* Annualized run rate was calculated by multiplying June 2015 revenue by twelve months.

Item 7
• We reached over 8 million paid Dynamics seats and refreshed and enhanced Microsoft Dynamics ERP products.
We also introduced new social, productivity, mobility, customer service, and marketing capabilities in Dynamics
CRM.
• We currently have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, with new customers signing up at a
current pace of nearly one million per month. We also surpassed 150 million downloads of Office mobile to iOS
and Android devices.
• Bing exceeded 20% U.S. market share as we focused our advertising business on search. In June 2015, we
entered into agreements with AOL and AppNexus to outsource our display sales efforts.
• In hardware, we released Surface 3 and expanded distribution of Surface Pro and the related gross margin
percentage grew with increased revenue, and introduced new categories like HoloLens – all with an eye toward
generating new growth in Windows more broadly.
• Xbox console volumes grew to over 12 million, and Xbox Live users increased 22%.
• We shipped over 36 million Lumia units, and announced the restructuring of our Phone Hardware business to
run it more effectively near-term while driving reinvention longer term.
• We completed 16 acquisitions, including Mojang Synergies AB (“Mojang”), the Swedish video game developer of
the Minecraft gaming franchise, and others, to strengthen our cloud platform and invest in mobile applications.
• We advanced Windows 10 to the threshold of its launch in July 2015 with the help of the Windows Insider
Program, a new paradigm to incorporate unprecedented levels of user and developer feedback in our
development process.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each
industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the
industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research
and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers, industry trends, and
competitive forces.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are
developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and
businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the
cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve
and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and
infrastructure will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and
industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working
environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products
and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is
correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and
expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may
significantly affect revenue and expenses. Recently, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain
foreign currencies has negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international
operations.

Item 7
See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year
due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers.
Our Computing and Gaming Hardware segment is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market
and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Typically, the Computing and Gaming Hardware segment
has generated approximately 40-50% of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter.
Unearned Revenue
Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue, including:
• Revenue deferred on pre-sales of Windows to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and retailers before
general availability.
• Revenue deferred on bundled products and services (“Bundled Offerings”).
• Revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the
“Windows Upgrade Offer”).
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-
based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to
being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.
Reportable Segments
The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting.
Segment information appearing in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial
Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis. All differences between our internal
management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), along with
certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other. Operating expenses are not allocated to our
segments. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on
consolidated net income or cash flows.
On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services business (“NDS”).
NDS has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. We report the financial
performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results
associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Licensing
segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Devices and Consumer
Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect
people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help
advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C segments are:
• D&C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume
licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume

Diluted earnings per share $ 1.48 $ 2.63 $ 2.58 (44)% 2%
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
Revenue increased $6.7 billion or 8%, reflecting a full year of Phone Hardware sales and growth in revenue from our
Commercial Cloud, Surface, server products, search advertising, and Xbox Live transactions. These increases were offset
in part by a decline in revenue from Office Commercial, Windows OEM, licensing of Windows Phone operating system,
and Office Consumer. Revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%.
Gross margin increased $787 million or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.0 billion or 22%
increase in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased, mainly due to Phone Hardware, as well as increasing costs in
support of our Commercial Cloud, including $396 million of higher datacenter expenses. Gross margin, as a percentage of
revenue, improved year over year in each of our reportable segments.

Table of Contents
PART II
Item 7
Operating income decreased $9.6 billion or 35%, primarily due to impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in
the current year, as well as increased research and development expenses, offset in part by higher gross margin. Key
changes in operating expenses were:
• Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion in the current year, reflecting goodwill and
asset impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware business, and $2.5 billion of integration
and restructuring expenses, driven by costs associated with our restructuring plans.
• Research and development expenses increased $665 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new
products and services, including NDS expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses.
Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were negatively impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses,
which decreased diluted EPS by $1.15.
Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
Revenue increased $9.0 billion or 12%, demonstrating growth across our consumer and commercial businesses, primarily
due to higher revenue from server products, Xbox Platform, Commercial Cloud, and Surface. Revenue also increased due
to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud-
based offerings.
Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase
in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface devices sold,
and $575 million of higher datacenter expenses, primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of
revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS.
Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased research and
development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
• Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, mainly due to increased investment in new
products and services in our Devices engineering group, including NDS expenses, and increased investment in
our Applications and Services engineering group.
• Sales and marketing expenses increased $535 million or 4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased
investment in sales resources, offset in part by lower advertising costs.

Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
D&C revenue increased $3.9 billion or 10%, primarily due to a full year of Phone Hardware sales, as well as higher
revenue from Surface, search advertising, and Xbox Live transactions, offset in part by a decrease in revenue from
Windows OEM, licensing of Windows Phone operating system, and Office Consumer. Collectively, Office Consumer and
Office 365 Consumer revenue declined 17%. D&C gross margin decreased $1.4 billion or 7%, reflecting higher cost of
revenue, offset in part by higher revenue. D&C cost of revenue increased $5.3 billion or 30%, mainly due to a full year of
Phone Hardware costs.
D&C Licensing
D&C Licensing revenue decreased $4.6 billion or 23%, mainly due to lower revenue from Windows OEM, Windows Phone
licensing, and Office Consumer. Windows OEM revenue declined $1.9 billion or 15%, primarily due to declines of 15% in
OEM Pro revenue and 16% in OEM non-Pro revenue. Windows OEM Pro revenue decreased, primarily due to benefits
realized from the expiration of support for Windows XP in the prior year, and declines in the business PC market. Windows
OEM non-Pro revenue declined, mainly due to an increased mix of opening price point devices sold, and declines in the
consumer PC market. Revenue from licensing of Windows Phone operating system decreased $1.4 billion or 55%,
primarily due to prior year revenue associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that terminated when we
acquired NDS. Office Consumer revenue declined $946 million or 29%, reflecting the transition of customers to Office 365
Consumer, where revenue is recognized ratably, and declines in the Japan PC market, where Office is predominantly pre-
installed on new PCs.
D&C Licensing gross margin decreased $3.6 billion or 20%, primarily due to the decline in revenue, offset in part by a
$990 million or 47% decrease in cost of revenue. D&C Licensing cost of revenue decreased, mainly due to a $788 million
decline in traffic acquisition costs, driven by prior year costs associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that
terminated when we acquired NDS.

Item 7
Computing and Gaming Hardware
Computing and Gaming Hardware revenue increased $1.1 billion or 12%, primarily due to higher revenue from Surface,
offset in part by lower revenue from Xbox Platform. Surface revenue increased 65% to $3.6 billion, primarily due to
Surface Pro 3 units sold. Surface Pro 3 was released in June 2014. Xbox Platform revenue decreased $385 million or 6%,
driven by lower prices of Xbox One consoles compared to the prior year, as well as a decrease in second- and third-party
video games revenue. We sold 12.1 million Xbox consoles in fiscal year 2015 compared with 11.7 million consoles in fiscal
year 2014.
Computing and Gaming Hardware gross margin increased $896 million or 100%, mainly due to higher revenue, offset in
part by a $194 million or 2% increase in cost of revenue. Gross margin expansion was driven by Surface, which benefited
from the mix shift to Surface Pro 3. Xbox Platform cost of revenue was comparable to the prior year.
Phone Hardware
Phone Hardware revenue increased $5.5 billion, as we sold 36.8 million Lumia phones and 126.8 million other non-Lumia
phones in fiscal year 2015, compared with 5.8 million and 30.3 million sold, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 following the
acquisition of NDS. We acquired NDS in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.
Phone Hardware gross margin increased $647 million, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by higher cost of
revenue. Phone Hardware cost of revenue increased $4.9 billion, and included $476 million of amortization of acquired
intangible assets in fiscal year 2015.
We recorded goodwill and asset impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware business in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2015. See further discussion under Impairment, Integration, and Restructuring Expenses below.
D&C Other
D&C Other revenue increased $1.8 billion or 26%, mainly due to higher revenue from search advertising, Xbox Live, first-
party video games, including Minecraft, and Office 365 Consumer. D&C Other revenue included an unfavorable foreign
currency impact of approximately 2%. Search advertising revenue increased $651 million or 22%, primarily driven by
growth in Bing, due to higher revenue per search and search volume. Xbox Live and other store transaction revenue
increased $531 million, driven by increased Xbox Live users and revenue per user. First-party video games revenue
increased $367 million, mainly due to sales of Minecraft following the acquisition of Mojang in November 2014, and new
Xbox titles released in the current year. Office 365 Consumer revenue increased $323 million, reflecting subscriber
growth.
D&C Other gross margin increased $629 million or 45%, due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $1.2 billion or 21%
increase in cost of revenue. D&C Other cost of revenue grew, mainly due to $372 million higher Xbox Live and other store
transaction costs, a $279 million increase in search infrastructure costs, $267 million higher retail stores expenses, and
$194 million higher first-party video games and Minecraft costs.
Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
D&C revenue increased $5.6 billion or 18%, primarily due to higher revenue from Xbox Platform, Surface, and Windows
Phone. Revenue also increased $2.0 billion due to the acquisition of NDS. D&C gross margin decreased slightly, reflecting
higher cost of revenue, offset in part by higher revenue. Cost of revenue increased $5.7 billion or 47%, mainly due to Xbox
Platform and Surface. Cost of revenue also increased $1.9 billion due to NDS.
D&C Licensing
D&C Licensing revenue increased $101 million or 1%, mainly due to increased Windows Phone revenue, offset in part by
lower revenue from licenses of Windows and Office Consumer. Windows Phone revenue increased $822 million or 48%,
mainly due to the recognition of $382 million revenue under our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia,

which concluded in conjunction with the acquisition of NDS, as well as an increase in phone patent licensing revenue.
Retail and non-OEM sales of Windows declined $274 million or 35%, mainly due to the launch of Windows 8 in the prior
year. Windows OEM revenue declined $136 million or 1%, due to continued softness in the consumer PC market, offset in
part by a 12% increase in OEM Pro revenue. Office Consumer revenue declined $249 million or 7%, reflecting the
transition of customers to Office 365 Consumer as well as continued softness in the consumer PC market. The declines in
Windows OEM and Office Consumer revenue were partially offset by benefits realized from ending our support for
Windows XP in April 2014.
D&C Licensing gross margin increased $454 million or 3%, primarily due to a $353 million or 14% decrease in cost of
revenue. D&C Licensing cost of revenue decreased, mainly due to a $411 million or 23% decline in traffic acquisition
costs.
Computing and Gaming Hardware
Computing and Gaming Hardware revenue increased $2.9 billion or 48%, primarily due to higher revenue from the Xbox
Platform and Surface. Xbox Platform revenue increased $1.7 billion or 34%, mainly due to sales of Xbox One, which was
released in November 2013, offset in part by a decrease in sales of Xbox 360. We sold 11.7 million Xbox consoles during
fiscal year 2014 compared with 9.8 million Xbox consoles during fiscal year 2013. Surface revenue increased $1.3 billion
or 157%, mainly due to a higher number of devices and accessories sold.
Computing and Gaming Hardware gross margin decreased slightly, due to a $3.0 billion or 58% increase in cost of
revenue, offset in part by higher revenue. Xbox Platform cost of revenue increased $2.1 billion or 72%, mainly due to
higher volumes of consoles sold and higher costs associated with Xbox One. Surface cost of revenue increased $970
million or 51%, mainly due to a higher number of devices and accessories sold, offset in part by a charge for Surface RT
inventory adjustments of approximately $900 million in fiscal year 2013.
Phone Hardware
Phone Hardware revenue was $2.0 billion in fiscal year 2014, reflecting sales of Lumia phones and other non-Lumia
phones following the acquisition of NDS on April 25, 2014. Since the acquisition, we sold 5.8 million Lumia phones and
30.3 million other non-Lumia phones in fiscal year 2014.
Phone Hardware gross margin was $54 million in fiscal year 2014, reflecting revenue of $2.0 billion, offset in part by $1.9
billion cost of revenue, including amortization of acquired intangible assets and the impact of decisions to rationalize our
device portfolio.
D&C Other
D&C Other revenue increased $583 million or 9%, mainly due to higher online advertising revenue and Office 365
Consumer revenue, offset in part by a $213 million decrease in first-party video games revenue, primarily due to the
release of Halo 4 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Online advertising revenue increased $497 million or
14%. Search advertising revenue increased 39%, primarily due to increased revenue per search resulting from ongoing
improvements in advertising products, higher search volume, and the expiration of North American revenue per search
guarantee payments to Yahoo! in the prior year, offset in part by a 25% reduction in display advertising revenue. Office
365 Consumer revenue grew $316 million, primarily reflecting subscriber growth. We ended fiscal year 2014 with over five
million subscribers.
D&C Other gross margin decreased $558 million or 29%, due to a $1.1 billion or 25% increase in cost of revenue, offset in
part by higher revenue. D&C Other cost of revenue grew, mainly due to a $541 million or 24% increase in online
advertising cost of revenue, reflecting support of online infrastructure. Cost of revenue also increased $219 million or 15%,
due to higher resale transactions costs.

NDS expenses. NDS general and administrative expenses were $77 million during fiscal year 2014.
IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses include costs associated with the impairment of goodwill and
intangible assets related to our Phone Hardware business, employee severance expenses and costs associated with the
consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities, and systems consolidation and
other business integration expenses associated with our acquisition of NDS.
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion for fiscal year 2015, compared to $127 million for
fiscal year 2014. The increase was mainly due to impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware
business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2015 indicated that the
carrying value of Phone Hardware goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill
impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing Phone Hardware’s goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign
currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of Phone Hardware
intangible assets. Restructuring charges were $2.1 billion, including employee severance expenses and the write-down of
certain assets in connection with our restructuring activities. Integration expenses increased $308 million, due to a full-year
of integration activities in fiscal year 2015 associated with the acquisition of NDS.
Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013

Total $ 346 $ 61 $ 288
We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit;
enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of
derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those
derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally
economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on
certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes.
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
Dividends and interest income decreased due to lower yields on fixed income securities, offset in part by higher portfolio
balances. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments
increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by higher other-than-temporary
impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $183 million in fiscal year 2015, compared with $106 million in fiscal
year 2014. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses on commodity contracts in the current period as compared to
gains in the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on currency and equity contracts. For fiscal year 2015, other reflects
recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.
Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
Dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances. Interest expense increased due to higher
outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of
equity securities and lower other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $106 million in
fiscal year 2014, compared with $208 million in fiscal year 2013. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher losses
on foreign exchange contracts, losses on equity derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period, offset in part by gains
on commodity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period. For fiscal year 2014, other reflects
recognized losses from certain joint ventures, offset in part by a recognized gain on a divestiture. For fiscal year 2013,
other reflects recognized gains on divestitures, including the gain recognized upon the divestiture of our 50% share in the
MSNBC joint venture.
INCOME TAXES
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was approximately 34% and 21%, respectively. The fiscal year 2015
effective rate increased by 13%, primarily due to goodwill and asset impairments and restructuring charges recorded in
fiscal year 2015, most of which did not generate a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal
statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our products
and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015,
this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a
result of impairment and restructuring charges.

Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax
rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our
products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating
center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign
regional operations centers. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and $7.1
billion, respectively, and comprised 40% and 26%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2015
and 2014, our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 60%
and 74%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.
Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $12.1 billion and $10.4 billion as of June 30, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to adjustments to prior years’
liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing and adjustments related to our IRS audits. While we settled a portion of the
I.R.S. audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we remain under audit for those years.
In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination.
As of June 30, 2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are
adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of
these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant
increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject
to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2015.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject
to examination for tax years 1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions
of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. Our effective tax rate
was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in
Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
Our fiscal year 2014 effective rate increased by 2% from fiscal year 2013 mainly due to adjustments of $458 million to
prior years’ liabilities for intercompany transfer pricing that increased taxable income in more highly taxed jurisdictions, as
well as losses incurred by NDS and changes in the geographic mix of our business. This was offset in part by favorable
transfer pricing developments in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily Denmark.
Changes in the mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries also impacted our effective tax
rates and resulted primarily from changes in the geographic distribution of and changes in consumer demand for our
products and services. We supply our Windows PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating
center, while we supply the Microsoft Office system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign
regional operations centers. Windows PC operating system revenue decreased $655 million in fiscal year 2014, while
Microsoft Office system and server products and tools revenue increased $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, during
this same period. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.1 billion and $6.7 billion,
respectively, and comprised 26% and 25%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2014 and
2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and
75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes.

preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among
industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include
foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest
rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve
economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is
insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 30, 2015, $94.4 billion was held by our foreign
subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and
other local regulatory) was $2.1 billion. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 79% of the cash equivalents and short-term
investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 5%
were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage-
and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars.
Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be
carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned
securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower.
Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $92
million as of June 30, 2015. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $287
million and $750 million, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations
in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the
fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange-
traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing
methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign
government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of
deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these
vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying
significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by
our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades.
Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these
investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced
investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these
investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and
independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Cash Flows
Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014
Cash flows from operations decreased $3.2 billion during the fiscal year to $29.1 billion, mainly due to an increase in
materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other
changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased
$686 million to $9.1 billion, mainly due to a $7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part
by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing increased $4.2
billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and
maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of
intangible and other assets.
Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013
Cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during fiscal year 2014 to $32.2 billion, mainly due to increases in cash
received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $2.0 billion
increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million
decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in proceeds from
issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, mainly due to a $10.5
billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4 billion increase in
cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital
expenditures for property and equipment.
Debt
We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the
low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes,
which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock,
acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of
this Form 10-K for further discussion.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue at June 30, 2015 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs.
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements
paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as
subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2015 also
included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox Live
subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; Office 365 subscriptions; Skype
prepaid credits and subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and
earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. While the program has no expiration date, we intend to complete
it by December 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2015, $21.9 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program.
During fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 295 million shares of Microsoft common stock for $13.2 billion under the share
repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated
losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our
ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our

We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of
technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and
equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales
and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of
our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices
and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated
entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in
foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor
foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments,
cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating
activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities,
and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we
expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be
sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital
expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund
significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future
earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could
result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds
domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
See Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further
discussion.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s
application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment
securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether
elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and
enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current
products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as
subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.

PART II
Item 7
Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade,
which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied
post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over
the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized
as products are shipped or made available.
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where
elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the
respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized
as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to
elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of
selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the
use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the
price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before
introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the
deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and
considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable.
In January 2015, we announced Windows 10 will be free to all qualified existing users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.
This offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch of new versions of Windows as it is being made available for
free to existing users in addition to new customers after the offer announcement. We evaluated the nature and accounting
treatment of the Windows 10 offer and determined that it represents a marketing and promotional activity, in part because
the offer is being made available for free to existing users. As this is a marketing and promotional activity, revenue
recognition of new sales of Windows 8 will continue to be recognized as delivered.
Impairment of Investment Securities
We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant
judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative
and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair
value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration
and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell,
the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely
than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related
to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in
technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-
temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is
established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We
evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation
approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating
segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances
could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or
sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of
assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of
each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a

discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows,
which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the
useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,
market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing as of May 1, 2015, we determined that goodwill associated
with our Phone Hardware reporting unit was impaired, resulting in a material charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2015. As of June 30, 2015, none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of impairment.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until
technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software
costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining
when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our
software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is
included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss
from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset
has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining
whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome
and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our
consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current
year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an
entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits
of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the
largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also
provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax
assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.
Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated
financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially
impact our consolidated financial statements.
