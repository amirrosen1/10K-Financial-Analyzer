Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an employee stock purchase plan (the “Plan”) for all eligible employees. Shares of our common stock may be
purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-
month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an
offering period. Employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented:
(Shares in millions)
Year Ended June 30, 2015 2014 2013
Shares purchased 16 18 20
Average price per share $ 39.87 $ 33.60 $ 26.81
At June 30, 2015, 157 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the Plan.
Savings Plan
We have a savings plan in the U.S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of
savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 75% of their salary, but not
more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with
a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the given
year. Matching contributions for all plans were $454 million, $420 million, and $393 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions in the U.S. plan are invested proportionate
to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the
U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be
invested in Microsoft common stock.
