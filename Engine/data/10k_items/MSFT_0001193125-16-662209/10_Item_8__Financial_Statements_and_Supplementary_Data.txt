ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity
prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign
currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness
of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian
dollar, and Australian dollar.
Interest Rate
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade
securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that
correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase
commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities.
Equity
Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We
manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate
with these indices.
Commodity
We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our
investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage
these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these
indices.
VALUE-AT-RISK
We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given
confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR
model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in
fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the
potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations
among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions.
The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively
stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model,
including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk.

Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $225 million as of June 30, 2016 and $237 million as of June 30,
2015. The total VaR is 29% less as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively, than the sum of the separate risk
categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated
net income or cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant
influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities are accounted
for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee
and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
Segment Information
In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and
platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief
Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new
segments described in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period
amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This
change primarily impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 15 – Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and
Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the
fair value of, and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles;
useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the
market value of and volume of demand for our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of
assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or
enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and
determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from
management’s estimates and assumptions.
Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
57
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue
Service revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately
disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income statements.
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications;
business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games;
hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related
accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers.
Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,
platforms, and content such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and
Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online
advertising.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether
elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where
elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the
respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized
as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to
elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of
selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the
use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the
price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before
introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the
deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and
considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable.
Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual
licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.
Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or
significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the
product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue
allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair
value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by
management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the
near future at the price set by management.
Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they
meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred
and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is
being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all
58
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does
not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products
are shipped or made available.
Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their Windows
10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are unable to
establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated
life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.
Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive
unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are
therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably
over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use
unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with
revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the
use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking possession of
software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue
ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-
based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a
particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.
Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings
that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However,
because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they
have the same revenue recognition timing.
Revenue related to Microsoft Surface (“Surface”) devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us, phones, and other
hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when
selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these
products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third
parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.
Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized
when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed.
Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the
consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services
arrangements is recognized as services are provided.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs
related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold
by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain
Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation
adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software
development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.
Product Warranty
We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the
related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected
59
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific
hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business,
but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties,
we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly
reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include
third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets,
and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are
included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our
software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,
trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6
billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for stock awards is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of
estimated forfeitures, over the related service period using the straight-line method. The fair value of stock awards is
based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not
received during the vesting period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured
as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of
such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as
long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value
measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. These levels are:
• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our
Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international
equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively
traded on exchanges.
60
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the
Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models
project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable
inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for
currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and
bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency
securities, and foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain
over-the-counter option and swap contracts.
• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using
model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-
derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock, and goodwill and intangible
assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the
models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when
they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on
valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables,
and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair
value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.
Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying
values.
Financial Instruments
Investments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to
be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with
original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid
nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments,
are reflected in OCI.
Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific
identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary
impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than
one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for
as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance
sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined
based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset
with a corresponding liability.
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is
calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a
systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative

evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we
evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent
to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the
investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely
than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related
to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in
technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-
temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is
established.
Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of
change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options
designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
are recognized in earnings.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is
initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is
recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either
hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily
recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as
commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying
available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-
temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”)
into other income (expense), net.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable
balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory

quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review
indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost
of revenue.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and
equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years;
computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to
20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment)
on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically
by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset
may be impaired.
Recent Accounting Guidance
Recently adopted accounting guidance
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard that changes the accounting
for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and tax
deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In addition, cash flows related
to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows.
The standard also allows us to repurchase more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding purposes without
triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee’s behalf for withheld
shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy
election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with early
adoption permitted.
We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any
adjustments as of July 1, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The
primary impact of adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in
capital for all periods in fiscal year 2016. Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes and minimum
statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to retained earnings as of July 1, 2015, where the cumulative effect
of these changes are required to be recorded. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to
determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period.
We elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all
periods presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from operations and net cash used in financing of $588
million and $271 million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The presentation requirements for cash
flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented on our
consolidated cash flows statements since such cash flows have historically been presented as a financing activity.

Item 8
Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes rather
than paid-in capital of $402 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as
noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes as current and noncurrent. This standard
is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied either prospectively or retrospectively to
all periods presented upon adoption.
We elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. While the
guidance changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet, we are still required to offset
deferred tax assets and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax jurisdiction. Adoption of the new standard
impacted our previously reported results as follows:

Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with
a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and
supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and other financial
instruments, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model for
recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities
will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the
securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning July 1,
2019. Application of the amendments is through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective
date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most prominent
among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating
leases under previous U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling
users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be
required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate
early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017 in conjunction with our adoption of the new revenue
standard. Our ability to early adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured from third-party
providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.

Item 8
We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing
to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting
for office, retail, and datacenter operating leases.
Financial Instruments – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure
In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation,
and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair
value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI. The new
standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018. The application of the amendments will result in a cumulative-
effect adjustment to our consolidated balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of
this standard on our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is
recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects
the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard
requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with
customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for
licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations.
The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective
method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial
application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full
retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented.
The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and adoption as of the original effective date of July 1,
2017 is permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new standard effective July 1, 2017. Our ability to early
adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on system readiness, including software procured from third-party
providers, and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to restate prior period financial statements.
We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing
to assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting
for software license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud offerings, and professional services to remain
substantially unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly
at the time of billing rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also expect to recognize license revenue at
the time of billing rather than over the subscription period from certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that
include both software licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license
subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on
contract-specific terms, and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of billing.
We currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from period to period is indicative of the net change in
revenue we expect from the adoption of the new standard.
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common
stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include
reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.
Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional
amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.
68
Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Foreign Currency
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and
forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and
are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these
foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.4 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively.
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the total
notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion for both periods.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign
exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30, 2016,
the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion,
respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold
were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively.
Equity
Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed
relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options,
futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may
use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of June 30,
2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion
and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively, were designated as hedging
instruments. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market
price risk were $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, were
designated as hedging instruments.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We
manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-
based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-
interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total
notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.
In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to
agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery
of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the total notional derivative
amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $548 million and $812 million, respectively.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to
facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to
individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit contracts
purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of
credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively.

Item 8
Commodity
We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use
swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to
broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase
and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of June 30,
2016, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882
million and $316 million, respectively.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the
standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2016, our long-term unsecured debt rating was
AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

NOTE 9 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Mojang Synergies AB
On November 6, 2014, we acquired Mojang Synergies AB (“Mojang”), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft
gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our
gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. The significant classes of assets and
liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928
million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily
attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We
assigned the goodwill to More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. Identifiable intangible assets
were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated
results of operations since the acquisition date.
Nokia’s Devices and Services Business
On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services business (“NDS”)
for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (the “Acquisition”). The purchase price
consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia’s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-
cash transaction, and liabilities assumed of $0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected to accelerate the growth of our
Devices business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.
The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of March 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and
liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows:
(In millions)
Cash $ 1,506
Accounts receivable (a) 754
Inventories 544
Other current assets 936

Current liabilities (4,575)
Long-term liabilities (890)
Total purchase price $ 9,442
(a) Gross accounts receivable was $901 million, of which $147 million was expected to be uncollectible.
(b) Goodwill was assigned to More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. The goodwill was
primarily attributed to increased synergies that were expected to be achieved from the integration of NDS.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we recorded $630 million of intangible and fixed asset impairment charges,
and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset impairment charges. The
impairment charges for both periods related to our phone business. These costs are included in impairment, integration,
and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement. See Note 10 – Goodwill and Note 11 – Intangible
Assets for additional details.
In May 2016, we announced an agreement to sell our entry-level feature phone assets for $350 million. The transaction is
expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
Our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692
million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.
Following are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the
Acquisition had been consummated on July 1, 2012:
(In millions, except per share amounts)
Year Ended June 30, 2014
Revenue $ 96,248
Net income $ 20,234
Diluted earnings per share $ 2.41
These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the
results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments
primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft
and NDS. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of
NDS. Acquisition costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance,
consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses
on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014.
Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint
strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or
loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition, we agreed
to license Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as
they are rendered.
Other
During fiscal year 2016, we completed 17 acquisitions for total cash consideration of $1.4 billion. These entities have been
included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.
Pro forma results of operations for Mojang and our other acquisitions during the current period have not been presented
because the effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated
results of operations.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months.
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the
periods in which the acquisitions occurred.
Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are
presented as “Other” in the above table. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between
business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal year 2015, a $5.1 billion goodwill impairment charge
was included in “Other,” as discussed below. This goodwill impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and
restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of
operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.
Our accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $11.3 billion.
As discussed in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 our chief
operating decision maker requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating
resources and assessing performance. This resulted in a change in our operating segments and reporting units. We
allocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment
of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no
impairment existed.
Goodwill Impairment
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow
methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow
approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.
No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2016 test.
Upon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was
determined to be impaired. Phone Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit within More Personal
Computing under our current segment structure. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its
sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results, along with
changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and
reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of these changes in strategy and
expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair
value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was
required.
Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second
phase of the goodwill impairment test (“Step 2”) was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value
of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology,

patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of
goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the
impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and
royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible
assets.
No other instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test.
NOTE 11 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows:

(a) Technology-based intangible assets included $115 million and $116 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, of net carrying amount of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we corrected our intangible assets in the table above for a $585 million
misstatement between gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization as of June 30, 2015. We do not consider this
correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements.
During fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million related to intangible assets in the Devices
reporting unit within our More Personal Computing segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested these
intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic
direction and reduced profitability expectations for our phone business. Based on the results of our testing, we determined
that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent
that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of
the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.
During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to intangible assets in our previous Phone
Hardware reporting unit. Phone Hardware intangible assets are included in the Devices reporting unit under our current
segment structure. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability due to
changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for
Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was
not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value.
We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine
the amount of impairment.
These intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on our
consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in
Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.
We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.

Short-term Debt
As of June 30, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest
rate of 0.43% and maturities ranging from 1 day to 99 days. As of June 30, 2015, we had $5.0 billion of commercial paper
issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from 8 days to 63 days.
The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.
We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on November 1, 2016 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These
credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with
the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No
amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented.
Long-term Debt
As of June 30, 2016, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $40.8 billion and $44.0
billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the

Income before income taxes $ 19,751 $ 18,507 $ 27,820
In fiscal year 2016, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals related to
the sales of Windows 10 of $6.0 billion and $588 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2015, income before income taxes
included the net impact of U.S. and foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our phone
business of $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively.
The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our
effective rate were as follows:

PART II
Item 8
The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in
Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S.
rate, generated 69%, 73%, and 81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In
general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and
2014, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in
the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, including the net impact of revenue
deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-
based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax
impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and
restructuring charges.
The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

Item 8
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid
or recovered.
As of June 30, 2016, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary
differences of approximately $124.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently
reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was
approximately $39.3 billion as of June 30, 2016.
Income taxes paid were $3.9 billion, $4.4 billion, and $5.5 billion in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $11.8 billion and $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease relates primarily to tax credits available for
carryover and a partial settlement of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009, offset by increases relating to intercompany
transfer pricing.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, were $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion, and $8.7 billion,
respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, by
$8.8 billion, $7.9 billion, and $7.0 billion, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion,
$1.7 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits
was $163 million, $237 million, and $235 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and was included in
provision for income taxes.
The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
(In millions)
Year Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014
Balance, beginning of year $ 9,599 $ 8,714 $ 8,648
Decreases related to settlements (201) (50) (583)
Increases for tax positions related to the current year 1,086 1,091 566
Increases for tax positions related to prior years 115 94 217
Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (317) (144) (95)
Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations (118) (106) (39)
Balance, end of year $ 10,164 $ 9,599 $ 8,714
While we settled a portion of our IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and
settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under
audit for those years. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and
reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing,
which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our
allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved
issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently
available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next
12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject
to examination for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions
of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 14 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Phone Hardware Integration
In July 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align NDS with our company’s overall
strategy (the “Phone Hardware Integration Plan”). Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated
approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions
related to the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were completed as of
June 30, 2015.
In connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred total restructuring charges of $1.3 billion, including
severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation and write-downs
of certain assets. All restructuring charges incurred under the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were recognized in fiscal
year 2015.
Phone Hardware Restructuring
In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the
“Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan”), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016.
In fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan,
including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously
estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware
Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of June 30, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of
calendar year 2016.
2016 Restructuring
We periodically evaluate how to best deploy the company’s resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management
approved restructuring plans that would result in job eliminations, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and
global sales. In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles
globally will be reduced during the year as an extension of the earlier plan, and these actions are expected to be
completed by the end of fiscal year 2017.
In connection with the restructuring plans, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in fiscal year 2016, including
severance expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur additional charges for these restructuring
plans in subsequent years.
Restructuring charges associated with each of these plans were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring
expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income
(loss) by segment in Note 21– Segment Information and Geographic Data.
Changes in the restructuring liability were as follows:
(In millions) Severance Other (a) Total
Restructuring liability as of June 30, 2015 $ 588 $ 249 $ 837

On June 11, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn”) for $196 per share
in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn’s net cash (the “Merger Agreement”). We will finance
the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously
approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in the 2016
calendar year, subject to approval by LinkedIn’s shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other
customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and
Dynamics.

NOTE 17 — CONTINGENCIES
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
IPCom patent litigation
IPCom GmbH & Co. (“IPCom”) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents
spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of
these patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014,
Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the
parties to pursue settlement discussions.
InterDigital patent litigation
InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed four patent
infringement cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against
other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless
communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT
sought an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in
Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In September
2015, in an inter partes review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final written decision that deemed
unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT has appealed this decision to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending final completion of the inter
partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust complaint
against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging the
unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. IDT filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court denied.
European copyright levies
We assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in various
European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are
based upon a 2001 European Union (“EU”) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted
works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording
devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation
against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that
include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant
cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts
sought in these countries. In December 2015, the industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a
settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-
2007 pending in Germany. In addition, the industry is engaged in settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting
society. We have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and France.
Other patent and intellectual property claims
In addition to these cases, there were 54 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2016.
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions
Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec,
Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft
operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims
China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation
In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) had begun a formal
investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file
verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and potentially other issues.
Product-Related Litigation
U.S. cell phone litigation
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior
Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused
their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS
acquisition and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are
consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that
operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are
pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were
manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to
manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.
In 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the
basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in part defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general
causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific
evidence, which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to hear en banc. Trial court proceedings are stayed
pending resolution of the appeal.
Canadian cell phone class action
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in
the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least
1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and
has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.
Other
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our
business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of June 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to
defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate
beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility
of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become
reasonably estimable.

Indemnifications
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have
agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. We
evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not
encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these
indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements.
