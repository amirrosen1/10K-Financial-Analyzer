NOTE 20 â€” EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS
We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. As of June 30, 2016 an aggregate of 214 million shares
were authorized for future grant under our stock plans. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares
generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy
exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.

Stock Plans
Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Stock awards generally
vest over a four or five-year service period.
Executive incentive plan
Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and
certain senior executives. The stock awards vest ratably in August of each of the four years following the grant date.
