NOTE 20 — EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS
We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. As of June 30, 2016 an aggregate of 214 million shares
were authorized for future grant under our stock plans. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares
generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy
exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.
Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:

Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Stock awards generally
vest over a four or five-year service period.
Executive incentive plan
Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and
certain senior executives. The stock awards vest ratably in August of each of the four years following the grant date.

Savings Plan
We have a savings plan in the U.S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of
savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary, subject to
certain limitations. Beginning January 2016, we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan,
with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year. Prior to January 2016, we
contributed fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributed in this plan, with a maximum contribution of
the lesser of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the calendar year. Matching
contributions for all plans were $549 million, $454 million, and $420 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively, and were expensed as contributed.
NOTE 21 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, reviews certain financial
information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP.
In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and
platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker requested changes in the
information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result,
beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments, Productivity and Business
Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of segment
profitability. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor
segment performance.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Productivity and Business Processes
Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,
communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:
• Office Commercial, including volume licensing and subscriptions to Office 365 commercial for products and
services such as Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses
(“CALs”).
• Office Consumer, including Office sold through retail or through an Office 365 consumer subscription, and Office
Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.
• Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP products, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and Dynamics
CRM Online.
