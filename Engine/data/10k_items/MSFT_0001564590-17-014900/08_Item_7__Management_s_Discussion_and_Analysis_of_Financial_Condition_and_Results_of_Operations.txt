ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is
intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A
is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying
Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
OVERVIEW
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to
achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our strategy
is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with
artificial intelligence (“AI”). We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices
that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives. Our platforms and tools help
drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new
startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.
We generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products, by offering a wide range of cloud-
based and other services to consumers and businesses, by designing, manufacturing, and selling devices that
integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most
significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our
products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.
Highlights* from fiscal year 2017 included:
• Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate** exceeded $18.9 billion.
• Office Commercial revenue grew 6%, driven by Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 46%.
• Office Consumer revenue grew 14%, and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 27.0 million.
• Microsoft Dynamics revenue grew 9%, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 78%.
• LinkedIn contributed revenue of $2.3 billion.
• Server products and cloud services revenue grew 13%, driven by Microsoft Azure revenue growth of 99%.
• Enterprise Services revenue decreased 2%, driven by a decline in revenue from custom support
agreements, offset in part by higher revenue from Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting
Services.
• Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased 3%.
• Windows Commercial revenue grew 5%, driven by multi-year agreement revenue.
• Microsoft Surface revenue decreased 2%, driven by a reduction in volumes sold, offset in part by a higher
mix of premium devices.
• Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, grew 9%.
• Gaming revenue decreased slightly, driven by lower Xbox hardware revenue, offset in part by growth in
Xbox software and services.
* Highlights are presented based on segment results.
** Commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the
quarter by twelve for Office 365 commercial, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties.
On December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion.
LinkedIn has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. See Note 9 –
Business Combinations in the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
In November 2016, we completed the sale of our feature phone business for $350 million.

PART II
Item 7
In July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016,
we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. Our change in phone strategy resulted
in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016 and 2017.
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each
industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the
industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research
and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry
trends, and competitive forces.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are
developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and
businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in
the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to
evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in
infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and
industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working
environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products
and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and
devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue
and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates
may significantly affect revenue and expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign
currencies throughout fiscal year 2015, 2016, and 2017, negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported
expenses from our international operations.
See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Seasonality
Our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year
due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers.
Reportable Segments
We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent
Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent
with our internal management reporting. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and
other activity, are included in Corporate and Other. We have recast certain previously reported amounts to conform to
the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Diluted earnings per share 2.71 2.10 1.48 29% 42%
Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016
Revenue increased $4.6 billion or 5%, driven by growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud,
offset in part by lower revenue from More Personal Computing. Productivity and Business Processes revenue
increased, driven by the acquisition of LinkedIn and higher revenue from Microsoft Office. Intelligent Cloud revenue
increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. More Personal Computing revenue
decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from Devices, offset in part by higher revenue from Windows and Search
advertising. Revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%.
Gross margin increased $3.1 billion or 6%, due to growth across each of our segments, including the acquisition of
LinkedIn, driven by higher revenue. Gross margin included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%. Gross
margin percentage increased slightly due to a margin percent increase in More Personal Computing and segment sales
mix, offset in part by margin percent declines in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud. Gross
margin percentage includes a 5-point improvement in commercial cloud gross margin primarily across Azure and Office
365.
Operating income increased $2.1 billion or 11%, primarily due to higher gross margin and lower impairment,
integration, and restructuring expenses, offset in part by an increase in research and development and sales and
marketing expenses. Operating income included an operating loss of $948 million related to the acquisition of LinkedIn,
including $866 million of amortization of intangible assets. Operating income also included an unfavorable foreign
currency impact of 4%. Key changes in expenses were:
• Cost of revenue increased $1.5 billion or 5%, mainly due to growth in our commercial cloud, the acquisition
of LinkedIn, and higher Search advertising traffic acquisition costs, offset in part by a reduction in phone
sales and Gaming cost of revenue.
• Research and development expenses increased $1.0 billion or 9%, primarily due to LinkedIn expenses and
increased investments in cloud engineering, offset in part by a reduction in phone expenses.
• Sales and marketing expenses increased $842 million or 6%, primarily due to LinkedIn expenses and
increased investments in sales capacity for our commercial cloud, offset in part by a reduction in phone and
marketing expenses.
• Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses decreased $804 million, driven by prior year asset
impairment charges and restructuring charges related to our phone business, offset in part by current year
employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan.
Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $2.71 for fiscal year 2017. Current year diluted EPS was negatively impacted
by the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease in diluted EPS
of $0.60. Diluted EPS was $2.10 for fiscal year 2016. Prior year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by the net
revenue deferral from Windows 10 and impairment and restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease in diluted
EPS of $0.69.
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015
Revenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6
billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%. Windows 10 revenue is primarily
recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition
of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other. More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower
revenue from Devices and Windows, offset in part by higher revenue from Search advertising and Gaming. Intelligent
Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and Enterprise
Services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased slightly, driven by an increase in Office and
Dynamics revenue.

goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of our previous Phone Hardware reporting
unit goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion,
reducing our Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency
remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of our Phone Hardware
reporting unit intangible assets. All remaining goodwill and intangible assets are included in our Devices reporting unit,
within More Personal Computing under our current segment structure. Restructuring charges were $2.1 billion, including
employee severance expenses and the write-down of certain assets in connection with our restructuring activities.
Integration expenses associated with the acquisition of NDS were $435 million in fiscal year 2015.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
The components of other income (expense), net were as follows:
( In millions)
Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015
Dividends and interest income $ 1,387 $ 903 $ 766
Interest expense (2,222) (1,243) (781)
Net recognized gains on investments 2,583 668 716
Net losses on derivatives (510) (443) (423)
Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements (164) (121) 335
Other (251) (195) (267)
Total $ 823 $ (431) $ 346
We use derivative instruments to: manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit;
enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of
derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than
those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally
economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and gains (losses) on
certain balance sheet amounts from foreign exchange rate changes.
Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016
Dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income
securities. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on
investments increased primarily due to higher gains on sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives increased
due to higher losses on equity derivatives, offset in part by lower losses on commodity and foreign currency derivatives.
Other, net reflects recognized losses from certain joint ventures and divestitures.
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015
Dividends and interest income increased due to higher portfolio balances and slightly higher yields on fixed-income
securities. Interest expense increased due to higher outstanding long-term debt. Net recognized gains on investments
decreased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments and lower gains on sales of fixed-income
securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to higher
losses on currency and equity contracts and lower gains on interest rate contracts in the current period as compared to
the prior period, offset in part by lower losses on commodity contracts. For fiscal year 2016, other reflects recognized
losses from divestitures and certain joint ventures.
INCOME TAXES
Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 8% and 15%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax
rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to
previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income

PART II
Item 7
taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. The fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of
nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory
rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our
products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous
phone business losses.
The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a
result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows
PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office
system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year
2017, our U.S. income before income taxes was $453 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $22.7
billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2017 U.S. income
before income taxes by $6.4 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $317 million. In fiscal year 2016, our
U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1 billion. Net
revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 U.S. loss by $6.0 billion and
foreign income before income taxes by $588 million.
Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period
intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits.
While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third
quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of
fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for
tax years 2010 to 2016. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to
transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably.
We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment
for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the
information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for
these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain
subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The
resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was 15% and 34%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower
than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland,
Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in
the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries including the impact of net revenue
deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to
stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the
tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of
impairment and restructuring charges.
The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a
result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. We supply our Windows
PC operating system to customers through our U.S. regional operating center, while we supply the Microsoft Office
system and our server products and tools to customers through our foreign regional operations centers. In fiscal year
2016, our U.S. loss before income taxes was $325 million and our foreign income before income taxes was $20.1
billion. Net revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2016 U.S. loss before
income taxes by $6.0 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $588 million. In fiscal year 2015, our U.S.
income before income taxes was $7.4 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $11.1 billion.
Impairment, integration, and restructuring expense relating to our phone business decreased our fiscal year 2015 U.S
income before income taxes by $1.1 billion and foreign income before income taxes by $8.9 billion.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.0 billion as of June 30, 2017, compared with $113.2
billion as of June 30, 2016. Equity and other investments were $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2017, compared with $10.4
billion as of June 30, 2016. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital
preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among
industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also
include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest
rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve
economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is
insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income
securities.
Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30, 2017, $127.9 billion was held by our foreign
subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency
and other local regulatory) was $2.4 billion. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 87% of the cash equivalents and short-
term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities,
approximately 3% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and approximately 2% were invested
in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining cash
equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were primarily invested in foreign securities.
Securities lending
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be
carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for
the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of
the borrower. Cash collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending
payable balance was $97 million as of June 30, 2017. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances
for fiscal year 2017 were $484 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities
loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine
the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S.
government securities, domestic and international equities, and exchange-traded mutual funds. If quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for
similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This
pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as foreign government bonds, corporate notes and bonds,
mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, common and preferred stock, and
certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of
our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these
vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without
applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is
not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the
investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker
prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-
priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for
these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are
recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period
fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Item 7
Cash Flows
Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016
Cash from operations increased $6.2 billion to $39.5 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in cash
received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes, offset in part by an increase in
cash paid to employees. Cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion
increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common
stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $22.8
billion to $46.8 billion, mainly due to a $24.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash
acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets, offset in part by a $1.9 billion decrease in cash used for net
investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015
Cash from operations increased $3.7 billion to $33.3 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to lower operating
expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from
customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $4.6 billion increase in
proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for common
stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $949 million to $24.0
billion, mainly due to a $2.4 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a $1.5 billion
increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $2.3 billion decrease in
cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets.
Debt
We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and
the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate
purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of
capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements
(Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs.
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements
paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as
subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 also
included payments for: Windows 10 licenses; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the
future; Office 365 subscriptions; LinkedIn; Xbox Live subscriptions; Dynamics business solutions products; Skype
prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue
when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017:
( In millions)

Item 7
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-
based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to
being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.
Share Repurchases
During fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased 170 million shares, 294 million shares, and 295 million
shares of our common stock for $10.3 billion, $14.8 billion, and $13.2 billion, respectively, through our share
repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. See Note 18 – Stockholders’ Equity of the
Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
Dividends
See Note 18 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have
agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business.
In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.
Contractual Obligations

Item 7
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of
technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and
equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development,
sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to
support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support
offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with
unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of
capital resources.
Liquidity
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested
in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of
our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor
foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments,
cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating
activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt
maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations
to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such
as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund
significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate
future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These
alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have
borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
See Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further
discussion.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s
application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of
investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist,
whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the
elements.
Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades
and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current
products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as
subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.
43
PART II
Item 7
Software updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade,
which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied
post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized
over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally
recognized as products are shipped or made available.
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where
elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the
respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is
recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating
revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best
estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry-specific software guidance which only
allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold
separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will
not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices
would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires
judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances
related to each deliverable.
Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their
Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we
are unable to establish VSOE. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the
estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.
The new standard related to revenue recognition will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
See Note 1 – Accounting Policies in the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further
discussion.
Impairment of Investment Securities
We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires
significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available
quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment
exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument
issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability
to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the
security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider
specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry
and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair
value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and
a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may
incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.
We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value
allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below
an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events
or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance
indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment
of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value
of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash
flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is
dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life
over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
44
PART II
Item 7
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,
market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until
technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software
costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining
when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our
software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is
included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated
loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that
an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In
determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the
current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized
in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is
more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the
technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax
positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these
future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and
manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities
on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews
include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing
strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our
inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are
presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s
estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at
reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial
records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These
systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful
selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.
The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render
an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that
each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting.
