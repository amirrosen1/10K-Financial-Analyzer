ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is
intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A
is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying
Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).
OVERVIEW
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to
achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms
and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also
support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.
We generate revenue by licensing and supporting an array of software products; offering a wide range of cloud-based
and other services to people and businesses; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant
online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees;
designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-
based services; and income taxes.
Highlights from fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 included:
• Commercial cloud revenue, which primarily comprises Microsoft Office 365 commercial, Microsoft Azure,
Microsoft Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties, increased 56% to $23.2 billion.
• Office Commercial revenue increased 11%, driven by Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 41%.
• Office Consumer revenue increased 11% and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 31.4 million.
• LinkedIn contributed revenue of $5.3 billion, driven by strong momentum across all business lines.
• Dynamics revenue increased 13%, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 65%.
• Server products and cloud services revenue increased 21%, driven by Azure revenue growth of 91%.
• Enterprise Services revenue increased 5%.
• Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased 5%, driven by
OEM Pro revenue growth of 11%.
• Windows Commercial revenue increased 12%, driven by an increased volume of multi-year agreements.
• Gaming revenue increased 14%, driven by Xbox software and services revenue growth of 20%, mainly from
third-party title strength.
• Microsoft Surface revenue increased 16%, driven by a higher mix of premium devices and an increase in
volumes sold, due to the latest editions of Surface.
• Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, increased 16%, driven by higher revenue per
search and search volume.
On June 4, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire GitHub, Inc. for $7.5 billion in an all-stock
transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. On December 8, 2016, we completed our
acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. LinkedIn has been included in our
consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 9 – Business Combinations of the Notes
to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing
U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net
charge of $13.7 billion related to the TCJA. Refer to Note 13 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part
II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
We adopted the new accounting standards for revenue recognition and leases effective July 1, 2017. These new
standards had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, our financial
results reflect adoption of the standards with prior periods restated accordingly. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of
the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

Item 7
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each
industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the
industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research
and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry
trends, and competitive forces.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are
developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and
businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in
the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to
evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in
infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and
industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment,
broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and
businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is
correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and
expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may
significantly affect revenue and expenses. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies throughout
fiscal year 2017 negatively impacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations.
This trend reversed in fiscal year 2018. Strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted
reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations.
Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Seasonality
We expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year.
Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season
spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts
executed during the period.
Reportable Segments
We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent
Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent
with our internal management reporting. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level
and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data
of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of
the TCJA in fiscal year 2018 and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal
year 2017. Our effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the net charge related
to the enactment of the TCJA, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our
foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a
result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2018, our
U.S. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. In
fiscal year 2017, our U.S. income before income taxes was $6.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes
was $23.1 billion.
Fiscal Year 2017 Compared with Fiscal Year 2016
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was 15% and 20%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax
rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to
previous Phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the
U.S. and foreign countries. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to
earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland,
Singapore, and Puerto Rico.
The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a
result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2017, our
U.S. income before income taxes was $6.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $23.1 billion. In
fiscal year 2016, our U.S. income before income taxes was $5.1 billion and our foreign income before income taxes
was $20.5 billion.

Recent Tax Legislation
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes
numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of
deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. The TCJA
required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a
rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA also
reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal year 2018, our
blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 28.1%. This is the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first and second
quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The
TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion
anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) measure that taxes certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its foreign subsidiaries.
The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018.
The TCJA was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As of June 30, 2018, we have not completed our
accounting for the estimated tax effects of the TCJA. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a provisional net charge of
$13.7 billion related to the TCJA based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. Due to the timing of the
enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions of the TCJA, the provisional net charge is subject to revisions
as we continue to complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional
guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), Financial Accounting Standards
Board, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income
taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Our accounting for the estimated tax
effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which is not expected to extend beyond one year
from the enactment date.
During fiscal year 2018, we recorded an estimated net charge of $13.7 billion related to the TCJA, due to the impact of
the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the
impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Uncertain Tax Positions
While we settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and a
portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for
those years. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013.
We continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2017. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its
2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June
30, 2018, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact in our
consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are
adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution
of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant
increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain
subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The
resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures which
exclude the net charge related to the TCJA, and impairment and restructuring expenses. We believe these non-GAAP
measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting
our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP
financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be
considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.8 billion and $133.0 billion as of June 30, 2018 and
2017, respectively. Equity and other investments were $1.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They
consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and
individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign
currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and
credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns
that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that
the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
As a result of the TCJA, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries are no
longer subject to U.S. tax on repatriation into the U.S.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine
the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S.
government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies
to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-
backed securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and U.S. agency securities. Level 3 investments are
valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
43
PART II
Item 7
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these
vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without
applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is
not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the
investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker
prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-
priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for
these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are
recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period
fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017
Cash from operations increased $4.4 billion to $43.9 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to an
increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees, net cash paid for
income taxes, cash paid for interest on debt, and cash paid to suppliers. Cash used in financing was $33.6 billion for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to cash from financing of $8.4 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2017. The change was mainly due to a $41.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments,
offset in part by a $1.1 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased
$40.7 billion to $6.1 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used
for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $19.1 billion
increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
Fiscal Year 2017 Compared with Fiscal Year 2016
Cash from operations increased $6.2 billion to $39.5 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in cash
received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes, offset in part by an increase in
cash paid to employees. Cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion
increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common
stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $22.8
billion to $46.8 billion, mainly due to a $24.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash
acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets, offset in part by a $1.9 billion decrease in cash used for net
investment purchases, sales, and maturities.
Debt
We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and
the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate
purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of
capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial
Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs and includes Software
Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally billed upfront at the beginning of each annual
coverage period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also
includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer
control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II,
Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.

The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2018:

March 31, 2019 5,995
June 30, 2019 3,141
Thereafter 3,815
Total $ 32,720
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-
based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to
being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.
Share Repurchases
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we repurchased 99 million shares, 170 million shares, and
294 million shares of our common stock for $8.6 billion, $10.3 billion, and $14.8 billion, respectively, through our share
repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Refer to Note 18 – Stockholders’ Equity of the
Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.
Dividends
Refer to Note 18 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have
agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business.
In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not
have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.
Contractual Obligations

(f) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $13.6 billion
from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned
revenue and non-cash items.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of
technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and
equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development,
sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to
support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices,
research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party
transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect
liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
Liquidity
As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax of $17.9 billion on deferred foreign income not
previously subject to U.S. income tax. In fiscal year 2018, we paid transition tax of $228 million. Under the TCJA, the
remaining transition tax of $17.6 billion is payable interest-free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five
years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight.
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital
markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing
activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax
related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further
discussion.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s
application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of
investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted
for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-
premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is
considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and
recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,
interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for
together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the
cloud services are provided.
46
PART II
Item 7
Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We
use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA
or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each
of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the
relative SSP of the various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we
determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically
have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by
customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and
geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of
delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain
instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and
updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated
variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
The new standard related to revenue recognition had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. Refer
to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further
discussion.
Impairment of Investment Securities
We review investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires
significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available
quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment
exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument
issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability
to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the
security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider
specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry
and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair
value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and
a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may
incur future impairments.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination.
We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value
allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below
an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events
or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance
indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment
of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value
of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash
flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is
dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life
over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
47
PART II
Item 7
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,
market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until
technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software
costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining
when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our
software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing.
Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is
included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated
loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that
an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In
determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the
current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on
the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities,
classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax
positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these
future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer
to Note 13 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further
discussion.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,
labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory
quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These
reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales
levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we
reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are
presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s
estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at
reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial
records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These
systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful
selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.
The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render
an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets
periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that
each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting.
Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.
