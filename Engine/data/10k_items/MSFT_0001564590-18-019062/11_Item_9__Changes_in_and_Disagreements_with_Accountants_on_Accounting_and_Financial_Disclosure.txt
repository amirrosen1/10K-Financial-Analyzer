PART II
Item 8
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2018, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 3, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for revenue
from contracts with customers and for accounting for leases in fiscal year 2018 due to the adoption of the new revenue
standard and new lease standard, respectively. The Company adopted the new revenue standard using the full
retrospective approach and adopted the new lease standard using a modified retrospective approach.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
