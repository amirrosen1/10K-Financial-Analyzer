ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Microsoft provided software services to a person or entity identified
under section 560.304 of title 31, Code of Federal Regulations. The services constituted a cloud-based spam and
malware filtering service and the cloud-based provision of Office 365 software services provided to two entities
associated with the Iranian bank, Bank Sepah – Bank Sepah International PLC and Banque Sepah, respectively. For
the former, an annual service fee equivalent to $600 was charged for a one-year period beginning in February 2017,
and for the latter, use rights were charged at a price equivalent to approximately $55 per month from September 2016
through November 2017, totaling $770. It is not possible to determine the precise profits, if any, attributable to these
activities, though they are less than the associated revenues. Microsoft has ceased providing these software services
to these entities and has no intention of doing so in the future.
