ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use
derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies
hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We
manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global
fixed-income indices.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit
exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.
