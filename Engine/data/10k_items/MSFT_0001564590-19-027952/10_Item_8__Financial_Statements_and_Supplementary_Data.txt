NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
We have recast certain prior period amounts related to investments, derivatives, and fair value measurements to
conform to the current period presentation based on our adoption of the new accounting standard for financial
instruments. We have recast prior period commercial cloud revenue to include the commercial portion of LinkedIn to
provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud business performance. The commercial portion of LinkedIn
includes LinkedIn Recruiter, Sales Navigator, premium business subscriptions, and other services for organizations. We
have also recast components of the prior period deferred income tax assets and liabilities to conform to the current
period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets,
consolidated income statements, or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash
flows statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue
recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the
standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as
product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible
assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based
compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of
uncertain tax positions that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and
determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from
management’s estimates and assumptions.
Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
Revenue
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications;
business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and
hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.
Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,
platforms, and content such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution
support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.
56
PART II
Item 8
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that
can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and
accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Nature of Products and Services
Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made
available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide
customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the
software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is
made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the
updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally
ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.
Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with
Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and
provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses
are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized
ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises
distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.
Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the
software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a
subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a
consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of
such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and
the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud
services are provided.
Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the
action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services
are provided.
Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot
function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single
performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or
directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.
Refer to Note 20 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant
product and service offering.
Significant Judgments
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer.
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted
for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-
premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is
considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and
recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration,
interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for
together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the
cloud services are provided.
57
PART II
Item 8
Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to
estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates
provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and
services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the
various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we
determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically
have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by
customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and
geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of
delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain
instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and
updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated
variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
Contract Balances
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when
revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For
multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We
record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional
right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.
As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $2.2 billion
and $1.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable
balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence.
Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

PART II
Item 8
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA
and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-
year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for
consulting services to be performed in the future; LinkedIn subscriptions; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live
subscriptions; Windows 10 post-delivery support; Dynamics business solutions; Skype prepaid credits and
subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer
control of the product or service.
Refer to Note 14 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in
unearned revenue during the period.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within
30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have
determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our
invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services,
not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the
beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises
licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.
Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of
those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the
requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented
and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the
amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation
program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate
with annual sales activities.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating
costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on
PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online
advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and
royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and
the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over
the estimated lives of the products.
Product Warranty
We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the
related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected
product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The
specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do
business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For
software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the
software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust
the amounts as necessary.
59
PART II
Item 8
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and
other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also
include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for
international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to
software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is
reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once
technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives
of the products.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,
trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6
billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units
(“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over
the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common
stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We
measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using
the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.
Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is
entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax
positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The
tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are
classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.
Financial Instruments
Investments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general,
investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are
classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term
based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is
available for current operations.
60
PART II
Item 8
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific
identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in OCI. Debt
investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated
based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a
systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating
potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the
fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that
we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to
the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in
technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-
temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is
established.
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily
determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable
changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on
a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is
less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted
for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance
sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined
based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an
asset with a corresponding liability.
Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income
(expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains and losses are initially
reported as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in revenue when the hedged exposure is recognized in
revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are
primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on
the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair
value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. These levels are:
• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our
Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual
funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.
61
PART II
Item 8
• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.
the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where
applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using
market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and
forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of
deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities,
corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily
include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.
• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined
using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level
3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, and goodwill and intangible
assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the
models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of
these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include
quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,
labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory
quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our
review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a
charge to cost of revenue.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property
and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven
years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements,
three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use
(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance
leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated
balance sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our
obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not
provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for
collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU
asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to
extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease
payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
62
PART II
Item 8
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For
certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease
component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the
operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating
segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated
period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by
taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset
may be impaired.
Recent Accounting Guidance
Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance
Income Taxes – Intra-Entity Asset Transfers
In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance requiring an entity to
recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer
occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We adopted the guidance effective July 1, 2018.
Adoption of the guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment
to retained earnings as of the effective date. We recorded a net cumulative-effect adjustment that resulted in an
increase in retained earnings of $557 million, which reversed the previous deferral of income tax consequences and
recorded new deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, partially offset by a
U.S. deferred tax liability related to global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). Adoption of the standard resulted in an
increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion, an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 billion,
and a reduction in other current assets of $152 million. Adoption of the standard had no impact on cash from or used in
operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.
Financial Instruments – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure
In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the
requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through
net income rather than OCI.
We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2018. Adoption of the standard was applied using a modified retrospective
approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained
earnings as of the effective date, and we elected to measure equity investments without readily determinable fair
values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. The cumulative-effect adjustment
included any previously held unrealized gains and losses held in AOCI related to our equity investments carried at fair
value as well as the impact of recording the fair value of certain equity investments carried at cost. The impact on our
consolidated balance sheets upon adoption was not material. Adoption of the standard had no impact on cash from or
used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.

PART II
Item 8
Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
Financial Instruments – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities
In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance expands
strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial
statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. The standard will be effective for us
beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period before the effective date.
Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We evaluated the impact of this standard on our consolidated
financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems, and do not expect the impact to be
material upon adoption.
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current
GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of
reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking
expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to
available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction
in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us beginning July
1, 2020. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. We
are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting
policies, processes, and systems.
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common
stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.
The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:
(In millions, except earnings per share)

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include
reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our
derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Foreign Currency
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and
forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and are designated as cash flow
hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and
Australian dollar.
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign
exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative
to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures,
and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. In the past, to hedge our price risk, we also used and
designated equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.
68
PART II
Item 8
Other
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We
manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-
based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to
agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical
delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default
swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices
and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing
exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain
minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral,
similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2019, our long-term
unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was
required to be posted.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments
are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between

Goodwill Impairment
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow
methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash
flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.
No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2019, May 1, 2018, or May 1, 2017 tests. As of June 30, 2019
and 2018, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion.

NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing
U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on
deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial
tax system. In fiscal year 2018, the TCJA required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously
subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the
remaining income. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In
addition, the TCJA subjected us to a tax on our GILTI effective July 1, 2018.
Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current
period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method,
under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA, due to the
impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part
by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities. During the second
quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional tax expense of $157 million, which related to completing our
provisional accounting for GILTI deferred taxes pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 118.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain
intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties
resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future
tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. GILTI tax.

PART II
Item 8
The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit
related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland,
Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net
charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed
at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 is primarily due to
earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore and
Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 82%, 87%, and 76% of our foreign income
before tax in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax
credits, GILTI, and U.S. state income taxes. In fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, there were no individually significant
other reconciling items.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net
charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax
benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The increase in our effective tax
rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of
the TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017.

Item 8
As of June 30, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $978 million, $770 million,
and $11.6 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from
fiscal 2020 through 2039, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire.
Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized
with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance.
The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other
net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.
Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $8.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $2.4 billion in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017,
respectively.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $13.1
billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.7 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years
2019, 2018, and 2017 by $12.0 billion, $11.3 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively.
As of June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $3.4 billion,
$3.0 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for
fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $515 million, $688
million, and $399 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits.
The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In
February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to
2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under
audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. We expect the IRS to begin an examination of tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next
12 months.
As of June 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and
do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we
do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain
subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The
resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 13 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
In June 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. In fiscal year 2017, we recorded
employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. The
actions associated with this restructuring plan were completed as of June 30, 2018.

Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been
recognized (“contracted not recognized revenue”), which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced
and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion as of June 30, 2019,
of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% of the revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder
thereafter. Many customers are committing to our products and services for longer contract terms, which is increasing
the percentage of contracted revenue that will be recognized beyond the next 12 months.
NOTE 15 — LEASES
We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail

NOTE 16 — CONTINGENCIES
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
There were 44 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2019, none of which are material
individually or in aggregate.
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions
Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec,
Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft
operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.
The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. Following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global
settlement of all three Canadian actions, and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three
jurisdictions for approval. The final settlement has been approved by the courts in British Columbia, Ontario, and
Quebec, and the claims administration process will commence.
Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims
China State Administration for Industry and Commerce Investigation
In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) (formerly State
Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law,
and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. The
SAMR has presented its preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China's Anti-Monopoly Law, and
discussions are expected to continue.
Product-Related Litigation
U.S. Cell Phone Litigation
Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that
radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed
responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been
substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial
proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by
federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured
before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the
science and testing around emission guidelines.
In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation
on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the
defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to
the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October
2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the
cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert
evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking
portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing is expected to be scheduled in the second half of calendar year 2019.

PART II
Item 8
Employment-Related Litigation
Moussouris v. Microsoft
Current and former female Microsoft employees in certain engineering and information technology roles brought this
class action in federal court in Seattle in 2015, alleging systemic gender discrimination in pay and promotions. The
plaintiffs moved to certify the class in October 2017. Microsoft filed an opposition in January 2018, attaching an expert
report showing no statistically significant disparity in pay and promotions between similarly situated men and women. In
June 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Plaintiffs sought an interlocutory appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which was granted in September 2018. Oral argument is scheduled for
October 2019.
Other Contingencies
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our
business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of June 30, 2019, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $386 million. While we intend to defend these matters
vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material
adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably
estimable.

generally vest over a four or five-year service period.
Executive Incentive Plan
Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and
certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest ratably over a four-year service period. PSUs generally vest over a
three-year performance period. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the extent to which the
corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

NOTE 20 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief
Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements
prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance
based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal
Computing.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Productivity and Business Processes
Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,
communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily
comprises:
• Office Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, comprising Office,
Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Skype for Business, and
related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”).
• Office Consumer, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer
Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.
• LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.
• Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and
CRM, Dynamics ERP on-premises, and Dynamics CRM on-premises.
Intelligent Cloud
Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can
power modern business. This segment primarily comprises:
• Server products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio,
System Center, and related CALs, GitHub, and Azure.
• Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of

PART II
Item 8
Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our
business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from
certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services,
which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a
profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating
expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.
In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to
them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human
resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including restructuring expenses.

stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019, and the related
notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 1, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to
those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial
statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Company’s Audit Committee and that: (1)
relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially

our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
