Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

PART II
Item 8
Revenue Recognition — Refer to Note 1 to the Financial Statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The
Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-
based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.
Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements,
and includes the following:
• Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should
be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold
with cloud-based services.
• Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and
services that are not sold separately.
• The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.
• Estimation of variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize (e.g., customer
credits, incentives, and in certain instances, estimation of customer usage of products and services).
Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments in determining revenue recognition
for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included
the following:
• We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the identification of distinct performance
obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable
consideration.
• We evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for
reasonableness.
• We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:
• Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and
other documents that were part of the agreement.
• Tested management’s identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of
distinct performance obligations and variable consideration.
• Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s
application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of
revenue recognition conclusions.
• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and
services that are not sold separately.
• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of
revenue recognized in the financial statements.
