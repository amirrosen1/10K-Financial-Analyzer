GENERAL
Embracing Our Future
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to
achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our
platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.
They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. As the
world responds to the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), we are working to do our part by
ensuring the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we
operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their best work while remote.
We continue to transform our business to lead in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. We bring
technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. Our unique role
as a platform and tools provider allows us to connect the dots, bring together an ecosystem of partners, and enable
organizations of all sizes to build the digital capability required to address these challenges.
In this next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial
intelligence (“AI”) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual
worlds are coming together with the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and mixed reality to create richer experiences that
understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and
relationships. A person’s experience with technology spans a multitude of devices and has become increasingly more
natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions.
What We Offer
Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for
customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential.
We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,
platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online
advertising to a global audience.
Our products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution
applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; and video games. We also design,

The Ambitions That Drive Us
To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:
• Reinvent productivity and business processes.
• Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.
• Create more personal computing.
Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes
At Microsoft, we’re providing technology and resources to help our customers navigate a remote environment. We’re
seeing our family of products play key roles in the ways the world is continuing to work, learn, and connect.
Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and
collaboration tools and services, including Office, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365,
Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools
that unlock creativity, increase teamwork, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data
protection. Microsoft Teams is enabling rapid digital transformation by giving people a single tool to chat, call, meet, and
collaborate. Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics to transform
business to business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives
human resource professionals a complete solution to compete for talent. Microsoft Power Platform empowers
employees to build custom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise.
These scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and discover new habits, while simplifying security and
management. Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-critical functions, redefining what they can expect from
their business applications. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement
with existing customers.
Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform
In the new remote world, companies have accelerated their own digital transformation to empower their employees,
optimize their operations, engage customers, and in some cases, change the very core of their products and services.
Partnering with organizations on their digital transformation during this period is one of our largest opportunities and we
are uniquely positioned to become the strategic digital transformation platform and partner of choice; their success is
our success.
Our strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our
services. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.
Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at
significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer,
geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources;
and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.
As one of the two largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we believe we work from a position of strength. Being a
global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security
and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are
accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from IoT sensors to gateway devices and
edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into
their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. Our hybrid
infrastructure consistency spans identity, data, compute, management, and security, helping to support the real-world
needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. We are accelerating our
development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. The opportunity to merge the physical and
digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads
which we believe will shape the next era of computing.

PART I
Item 1
The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for
customers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize
built-in AI. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every
developer be an AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple
machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and
data science.
Create More Personal Computing
We strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact
with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. In support of this, we are bringing Office, Windows, and
devices together for an enhanced and more cohesive customer experience.
Windows 10 serves the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. It empowers people with AI-
first interfaces ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling, and
mixed reality experiences. Our ambition for Windows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services,
subscriptions, and search advertising. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business and Microsoft 365
strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the “intelligent edge.”
We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device
categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. We recently added several new products and
accessories into the Surface family, including Surface Book 3 and Surface Go 2. These new Surface products join
Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 3, and Surface Pro X.
To expand usage and deepen engagement, we continue to invest in content, community, and cloud services as we
pursue the expansive opportunity in the gaming industry. We are broadening our approach to how we think about
gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed across PC,
console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers. Xbox
Game Pass, with over 10 million members from 41 countries, is a community with access to a curated library of over
100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Project xCloud is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that is
complementary to our console hardware and will give fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the
people they want, on the devices they want.
Our Future Opportunity
In a time of great disruption and uncertainty, customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations
as software and cloud computing play a huge role across every industry and around the world. We continue to develop
complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while
safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of
technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant
resources in:
• Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people
communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.
• Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for
businesses and individuals.
• Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer’s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs
using natural methods of communication.
• Using Windows to fuel our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and to develop new categories of
devices – both our own and third-party – on the intelligent edge.
• Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any
devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of
entertainment.
Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales
motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new
solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.

COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19
pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial
markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain
the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from
home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. To protect the health and well-being of
our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies,
implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted our conferences
and other marketing events to virtual-only through fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may
continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there
is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. Refer to Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion
regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2020 financial results.
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving
factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and
individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of
recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government
spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This
uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability
in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-
looking guidance. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other
risks.
Commitment to Sustainability
We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We’re empowering our customers
and partners with new technology to help them drive efficiencies, transform their businesses, and create their own
solutions for sustainability. In January 2020, we announced a bold new environmental sustainability strategy focused on
carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. As part of our commitment, we are investing $1 billion over the next four years
in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We set an ambitious goal to reduce and ultimately remove
Microsoft’s carbon footprint. By 2030 Microsoft will be carbon negative, and by 2050 Microsoft will remove from the
environment all the carbon the company has emitted directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975.
We also launched a new initiative to use Microsoft technology to help our suppliers and customers around the world
reduce their own carbon footprint.
The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our
devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services help businesses
cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. We also pledged a $50 million
investment in AI for Earth to accelerate innovation by putting AI in the hands of those working to directly address
sustainability challenges. Lastly, this work is supported by using our voice to support policies we think can advance
sustainability efforts.
Addressing Racial Injustice
Our future opportunity depends on reaching and empowering all communities, and we are committed to taking action to
help address racial injustice and inequity. With significant input from employees and leaders who are members of the
Black and African American community, our senior leadership team and board of directors has developed a set of
actions to help improve the lived experience at Microsoft and drive change in the communities in which we live and
work. These efforts include increasing our representation and culture of inclusion by doubling the number of Black and
African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the United States by 2025;
engaging our ecosystem by using our balance sheet and engagement with suppliers and partners to extend the vision
for societal change; and strengthening our communities by using the power of data, technology, and partnership to help
improve the lives of Black and African American citizens across the United States.

Investing in Digital Skills
With a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is making efforts to help ensure that no one is left behind,
particularly as economies start to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are expanding access to the digital skills
that have become increasingly vital to many of the world’s jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job
losses, including those with lower incomes, women, and underrepresented minorities. Our skills initiative brings
together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft
Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. This is combined with $20 million we are
investing in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business
Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a
comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives

We design, manufacture, and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable
people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated
Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more
productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product
roadmap, and expanding into new categories.
Gaming
Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content,
community, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party
studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and
content to expand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the
cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over
100 first- and third-party console and PC titles.
The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage
both on- and off-console with both the launch of Project xCloud, our game streaming service, and continued investment
in gaming hardware. Project xCloud utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-demand
streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices, enabling gamers to take their favorites games with them
and play on the device most convenient to them. Project xCloud will provide players with more choice over how and
where they play.
Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is accessible on Xbox consoles,
Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox Live is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network
of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a
large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as
well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox
enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power
and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through
first-party content creators.
Search
Our Search business, including Bing and Microsoft Advertising, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a
global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Verizon Media Group, through which
we provide and monetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and
match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings.

significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment
services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital
content offerings.
Our search business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals
that provide content and online offerings to end users.
OPERATIONS
We have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing,
credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland
supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater
China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico,
Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations
centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle
East and Africa.
To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international
markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require
modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.
Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use
other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. The majority of our
hardware products contain components for which there is only one qualified supplier. Extended disruptions at these
suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property
We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.
• Cloud and AI, focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and
efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and
development tools, AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for
enterprises.
• Experiences and Devices, focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences
and devices, including Office, Windows, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Surface.
• AI and Research, focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development
efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search.
• LinkedIn, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.
• Gaming, focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help
grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.

PART I
Item 1
Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer
technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and
enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as
possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before
releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide
application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also
create product documentation internally.
We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to
ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and
hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing
patents and currently have a portfolio of over 63,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 24,500 pending
worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and
services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’
products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering
entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At
times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as
promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development
community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property
rights broadly in certain situations.
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services,
and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be
obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not
materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our
products.
Investing in the Future
Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to
initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad
adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we
believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our
assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a
wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI,
devices, and operating systems.
While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate
research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Czech
Republic, India, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local
markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.
In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research
is one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities
around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing
us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation.
We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product
considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating
segment level. Much of our segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and
leveraged across the Company. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and
development efforts.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING
We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and
resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and
public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements;
managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners
who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and
services.
OEMs
We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they
sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs
also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the
capability to subscribe to Office 365.
There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them
is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering
one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-
Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of
OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-
installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct
agreement or relationship with Microsoft.
Direct
Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and
Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web
agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement
Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate
customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many
of these sales.
We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search,
and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In June 2020, we announced a strategic change in our
retail operations, including closing our Microsoft Store physical locations.
Distributors and Resellers
Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”),
distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach
organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs,
and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as
resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for
reselling cloud services.
We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized
replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We
distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support
personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support.
Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners
providing vertical solutions and specialized services.

LICENSING OPTIONS
We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and Software
Assurance. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire
multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We
use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may
differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.
SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also
provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA
is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.
Volume Licensing Programs
Enterprise Agreement
Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility
to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or
large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year
period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.
Microsoft Product and Services Agreement
Microsoft Product and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license
cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-
expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers
that purchase perpetual licenses.
Open
Open agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open agreements are
designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one-
to three-year period. Under the Open agreements, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Under
Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is
included.
Select Plus
Select Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at
any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual
licenses and SA is optional.
Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement
Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to,
activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers
to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.
Partner Programs
The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need
in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud
reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision,
manage, and support their customer subscriptions.
The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software
vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications
to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on
consumption.

Item 1
The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other
applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.
CUSTOMERS
Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector
institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly
upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.
