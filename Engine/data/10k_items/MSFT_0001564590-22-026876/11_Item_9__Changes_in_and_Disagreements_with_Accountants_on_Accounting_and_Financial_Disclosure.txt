Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

PART II
Item 8
Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain
unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for
tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining
matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment
and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit
settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the
IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit
effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer
pricing issues included the following:
• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the
identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the
effectiveness of the related internal controls.
• We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained
by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.
• We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax
positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.
• For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had
appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of
the uncertain tax positions.
• We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes,
regulations and case law, impacted management's judgments.
