Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Amazon.com, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31,
2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or
complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate
opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of the The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in
Matter Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax
positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in
evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses
significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to
be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31,
2020, the Company accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion for various tax contingencies.
Auditing the measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of
whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various
tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and
legal rulings.
36Table of Contents
How We Addressed We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies,
the Matter in Our including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained,
Audit management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related
disclosures.
We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in
assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the
specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our
procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s
correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are
based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax
laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies.
We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the
Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the Company’s
assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the
Company’s calculations. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in
relation to these matters.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES
Description of Business
We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets,
consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical
stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their
products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app
developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a
broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other
services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors,
publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment
Information.”
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Proceeds from short-term
debt, and other” were reclassified from “Proceeds from long-term debt and other” and “Repayments of short-term debt, and other”
were reclassified from “Repayments of long-term debt and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the
“Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we
are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities.
Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment,
commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor
funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Given the global
economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates have become more
challenging, and actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2020 we changed our estimate of the
useful life for our servers from three years to four years. The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware,
software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on servers that
were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019 and those acquired during the year ended December 31,
2020, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or
$4.06 per basic share and $3.98 per diluted share.

Property and equipment acquired under build-to-suit arrangements $ 3,641 $ 1,362 $ 2,267
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is
calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined
under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings
per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.
The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):

Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 487 494 500
Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 10 10
Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 500 504 510
Revenue
Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return
allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including
sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the
prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.
A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:
Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the
goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon
delivery, to the customer.
Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through
us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn
from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related
products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.
Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content
including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide
our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for
at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.
AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to
services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity
of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database,
are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in
connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.
44Table of Contents
Other - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the
number of clicks or impressions.
Return Allowances
Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return
allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $623 million, $712 million, and $859 million as of
December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additions to the allowance were $2.3 billion, $2.5 billion, and $3.5 billion and deductions
from the allowance were $2.3 billion, $2.5 billion, and $3.6 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Included in “Inventories” on our
consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $519 million, $629 million, and $852 million as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and
2020, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including
costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs
where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in
our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction
costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of
operations.
Vendor Agreements
We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions,
incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay
for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of
services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We
evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can
be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.
Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International
segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving,
inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and
related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from
customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to
third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.
Technology and Content
Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development
of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products
and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking
equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and
other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and
services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred.
Marketing
Marketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and
selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals
result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.
Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $8.2 billion,
$11.0 billion, and $10.9 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
45Table of Contents
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related
expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and
litigation costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and
recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and
the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures,
using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent
actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in
the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture
experience and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to
settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or
expiration.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity
of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of valuations and adjustments of equity securities of $145 million, $231
million, and $833 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020, equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $(131) million, $11 million, and $1.5
billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and foreign currency gains (losses) of $(206) million, $(20) million, and $35 million in 2018,
2019, and 2020.
During the period from January 1, 2021 to February 2, 2021, we expect to record upward adjustments relating to equity
investments in private companies of approximately $1.5 billion. In addition, for this same period, our equity and equity warrant
investments in public companies, which are subject to volatility based on changes in market prices, have experienced gains of
approximately $1.5 billion based on available trading prices.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses
are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to
invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of
the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected
to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are
evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider
many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss
experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods
available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make
estimates of future earnings in relevant jurisdictions more challenging.
We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first
step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than
not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to
measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We
consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments
and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in
income tax expense.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets
that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably
available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in
inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated
by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of
December 31, 2019 and 2020.
We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these
warrants had a fair value of $669 million and $3.0 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance
sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These
warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are
valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available
information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or
liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-
down of inventory, was $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.
We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain
ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these
products are not included in our inventories.
We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide
manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and
help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device
components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable
commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur
additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.
Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to
customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, customer receivables, net, were $12.6 billion and $14.8
billion, vendor receivables, net, were $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $863 million and $381 million.
Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to
procure inventory.
We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables
are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance
with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $495 million, $718 million, and $1.1 billion as of
December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additions to the allowance were $878 million, $1.0 billion, and $1.4 billion, and deductions to
the allowance were $731 million, $793 million, and $1.0 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
47Table of Contents
Software Development Costs
We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use
software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs,
including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from
property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along
with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the
construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy
equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years prior to
January 1, 2020 and four years subsequent to January 1, 2020 for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for
heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified
within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.
Leases
We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are
generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under
finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases
generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.
Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of
property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are
accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone
prices.
Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a
discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value
of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments
reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the
lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.
When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the
leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification
and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices,
market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.
Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of
the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest
component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.
We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination
or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are
accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.
Financing Obligations
We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control
over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the
arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or
the term of the obligation.
If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are
derecognized, and we classify the lease as either operating or finance.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs
or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to
evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its
carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived
intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an
impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future
cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category
expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.
We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as
of April 1, 2020, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.
There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired
Intangible Assets.”
Other Assets
Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net
of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; certain equity investments; equity
warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement.
Digital Video and Music Content
We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing
agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license
fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an
asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to
“Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee
is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also
develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an
accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our
capitalized video content is 2.5 years.
Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major
geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs
or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is
primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 were $5.8 billion and $6.8 billion. Total video and music
expense was $7.8 billion and $11.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. Total video and music expense
includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated
with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.
Investments
We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term
fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value
below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted
recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated
statements of operations.
Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted
for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our
consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of
operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our
assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other
publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2019 and
2020, these investments had a carrying value of $1.5 billion and $2.7 billion.
49Table of Contents
Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise
significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our
consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis
differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on
our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value
are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.
Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated
balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements
of operations.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would
necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change
in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying
amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based
on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain
criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its
immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of
cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.
Accrued Expenses and Other
Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and
asset retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, tax-related liabilities, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current
debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $4.3 billion and $7.6 billion and our
liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $3.3 billion and $4.7 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a
customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is
recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime
memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $10.2 billion, of which $7.9 billion was recognized as
revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $11.6 billion.
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion of unearned revenue
as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.
Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer
contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that
exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $50.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average
remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.4 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by
customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.
Other Long-Term Liabilities
Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing
obligations, asset retirement obligations, deferred tax liabilities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music
content.
Foreign Currency
We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly
incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that
either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates
50Table of Contents
prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a
separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on
our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our
consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we
recorded gains (losses) of $(186) million, $95 million, and $118 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Note 5 — ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
2018 Acquisition Activity
On April 12, 2018, we acquired Ring Inc. for cash consideration of approximately $839 million, net of cash acquired, and on
September 11, 2018, we acquired PillPack, Inc. for cash consideration of approximately $753 million, net of cash acquired, to
expand our product and service offerings. During 2018, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price
of $57 million.
2019 Acquisition Activity
During 2019, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $315 million, net of cash acquired.
2020 Acquisition Activity
During 2020, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, of which
$1.1 billion was capitalized to in-process research and development intangible assets (“IPR&D”).
The primary reason for all acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more
effectively. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of 2020 acquisitions, individually and in the
aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.
54Table of Contents
Goodwill
The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and
functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible
assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax
purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2019 and 2020 by segment (in millions):

Note 6 — DEBT
As of December 31, 2020, we had $32.2 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the “Notes”), including $10.0 billion
issued in June 2020 for general corporate purposes. We also have other long-term debt and borrowings under our credit facility of
$1.6 billion and $924 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our total long-term debt obligations are as follows (in millions):

(1) The weighted average remaining lives of the 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020 Notes were 1.9, 11.8, 16.2, and 18.7 years as of
December 31, 2020. The combined weighted average remaining life of the Notes was 15.8 years as of December 31, 2020.
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to
time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value
of the Notes was approximately $26.2 billion and $37.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which is based on quoted prices
for our debt as of those dates.
In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain
seller receivables, which we subsequently increased to $740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to
lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank
offered rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.40%, and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There were $740 million and
$338 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which had a weighted-
average interest rate of 3.4% and 3.0%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged $852 million and $398
million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit
Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.
Other long-term debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.1% and 2.9% as of
December 31, 2019 and 2020. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business
operations. The estimated fair value of other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as
of December 31, 2019 and 2020.

In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from
time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but
will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In June 2020, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Program to $10.0
billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2019. There were $725
million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2020, which are included in “Accrued
expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and have a weighted average effective interest rate, including issuance
costs, of 0.11%. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.
In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit
facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $7.0 billion. In June
2020, we further amended and restated the Credit Agreement to extend the term to June 2023, and it may be extended for up to
three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the amended
and restated Credit Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50%, with a commitment fee of 0.04% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility.
There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.
We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. These amounts are included in “Accrued
expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $5.1 billion of unused letters of credit as of
December 31, 2020.

(1) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores and long-
term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For
those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum
quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option
of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.
(2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease
arrangements that are under construction, asset retirement obligations, and liabilities associated with digital media content
agreements with initial terms greater than one year.
(3) Excludes approximately $2.8 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of
the amount and period of payment, if any.
Pledged Assets
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged or otherwise restricted $994 million and $875 million of our cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-
party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller
receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.”
Suppliers
During 2020, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or
arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit
limits.
Other Contingencies
We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes),
including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to
pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South
Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including
interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-
party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and
we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we
could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:
In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc.,
and Amazon Web Services, LLC for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The
complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual Private Cloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling, and Elastic Beanstalk
infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, entitled “System and Method for Maintaining N Number of Simultaneous Cryptographic
Sessions Using a Distributed Computing Environment.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages,
enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court
for the Western District of Washington. In June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January 2019, the stay of the case was lifted following resolution of the review
petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on
www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed
Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded
Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’
fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In
February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130-$250
million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc.
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa
Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using
Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced
damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing
and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent
Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol,” and 7,233,978, entitled
“Method And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network Separate From The Data To Which The Location
Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest,
and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
Beginning in March 2020, a number of class-action complaints were filed alleging, among other things, price fixing
arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and third-party sellers in Amazon’s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization
of an alleged market in online retail or other submarkets, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. In March 2020,
Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Beginning
in April 2020, class action complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Quebec – Division of Montreal, the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice, and the Federal Court of Canada against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities. The complaints allege several
distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a
product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages,
treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in these matters.
In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to
our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified
fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings,
involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data
protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.
The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant
uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular
59Table of Contents
basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in
excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and
disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such
an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could
potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates
and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could
have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Common Stock Available for Future Issuance
As of December 31, 2020, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 102 million shares.
Note 9 — INCOME TAXES
In 2018, 2019, and 2020, we recorded net tax provisions of $1.2 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.9 billion. Tax benefits relating to
excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash
taxes paid, net of refunds, were $1.2 billion, $881 million, and $1.7 billion for 2018, 2019, and 2020.
U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is
referred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction (“FDII”). In addition, certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses
are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax
rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property,
primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018
and 2019 and a partial election for 2020.

(1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision
includes $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.8 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2018, 2019, and
2020.
Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a
decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act
recognized in 2018.
Our provision for income taxes in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was
partially offset by the impact of developments in our ongoing global tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings and
losses, an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and an increase in our foreign income deduction under
FDII. In addition, our Luxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilized deferred tax assets previously subject to
valuation allowances.
We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,
indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such
amounts.

___________________
(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.
(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign
taxing jurisdictions.
Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net
operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2020. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of
December 31, 2020 were approximately $13.4 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual
limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2021. All remaining federal tax
credits, which were primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, reduced our federal tax liability in 2020.
We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in
which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including
recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-
forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on
our business make estimates of future earnings more challenging. Since Q2 2017, we have recorded a valuation allowance against
our net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. There is still significant uncertainty whether our earnings in Luxembourg are
sustainable in the future and we will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a release
of the valuation allowance.
Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,
there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-
related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are
established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully
supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision
for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.

___________________
(1) As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.8 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $1.5 billion, if fully
recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. The decrease in our tax contingencies in 2020 was primarily a result of
developments in our global tax controversies.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax
contingencies of $131 million and $83 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years
ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 was $20 million, $4 million, and $(48) million.
We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year
2013 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net
operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. During Q3 2020, we resolved the audits of
tax years 2007 through 2012 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual.
In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax
authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union
rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities
in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission
announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014,
and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg
computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March
2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European
Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be without merit and will
continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign
jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to,
audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for
2009 and thereafter.
Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon
resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within
the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax
examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to
positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and
nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.
Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment
results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on
usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs
are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred
in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable
segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and
manages its operations.
64Table of Contents
North America
The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these
online stores.
International
The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from
sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these
internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and
Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.
AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-
ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.
