NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated
net income or cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant
influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities are accounted
for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee
and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the
fair value of, and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangibles assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles;
useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the
market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the
elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new
products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when
investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates
and assumptions.
Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes
collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether
elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where
elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the
respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized
as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to
elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence,
58Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance
which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the
deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that
the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the
selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs
requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and
circumstances related to each deliverable.
Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual
licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.
Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or
significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the
product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue
allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair
value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price determined by
management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the
near future at the price set by management.
Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they
meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be deferred
and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (“PCS”) is
being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the
arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates
are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made
available.
Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive
unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are
therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably
over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use
unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions, with
revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period.
Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a
contractually determined period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with
billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date
the service is made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a
consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the
customer utilization of such resources.
Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings
that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However,
because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they
have the same revenue recognition timing.
Revenue related to phones, Surface devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is
generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through
Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined
with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the
Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.
Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized
when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been
59Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly
rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price
services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase
of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs
related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold
by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain
Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation
adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software
development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.
Product Warranty
We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the
related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product
failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific
hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business,
but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties,
we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly
reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include
third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets,
and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are
included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our
software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,
trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.9
billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as
expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four
to five years) using the straight-line method.
60Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of
the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is
measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of
international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of
such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The deferred income taxes are classified as
current or long-term based on the classification of the related asset or liability.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value
measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. These levels are:
• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Our
Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international
equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively
traded on exchanges.
• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the
Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models
project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable
inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for
currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist primarily of corporate notes and
bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency
securities, and foreign government bonds. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain
over-the-counter option and swap contracts.
• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using
model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 non-
derivative assets primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock and goodwill when it is
recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to
the fair values of the assets and liabilities. Our Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include equity
derivatives.
We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when
they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined based on
valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables,
and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair
value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.
Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying
values.
61Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Financial Instruments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to
be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with
original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid
nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments,
are reflected in OCI.
Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. With the exception of
certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the
market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Held-to-
maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other investments that
are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be
carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned
securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower.
Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is
calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a
systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating
potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value
is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income
securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required
to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and
business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and
financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is
recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of
change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options
designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and
are recognized in earnings.
For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is
initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is
recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either
hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily
recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment
62Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses)
in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or
other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income (“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable
balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

Write-offs (43) (51) (57)
Balance, end of period $ 335 $ 301 $ 336
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and
manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on
hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a
reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.
The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis
require significant judgment.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as
follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three
years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and
equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment)
on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically
by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset
may be impaired.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In May 2014, as part of its ongoing efforts to assist in the convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard related to revenue recognition.
Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in
an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In
addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and adoption as of the
original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted. We anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact.
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common
stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.
The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:

In addition to the investments in the table above, we also own corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity
investments, which are included in equity and other investments on the balance sheet. These corporate notes are due
October 31, 2023 and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of June 30, 2015, the amortized cost and
recorded basis of these corporate notes were both $25 million with an estimated fair value that approximates the carrying
value. As of June 30, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes was $1.5
billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164 million.
As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one
year or are not publicly traded were $561 million and $520 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and
are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the
fair value of these investments.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for
as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or
security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the
underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. As of June 30, 2015, collateral received under these
agreements totaled $92 million which is comprised of $79 million of certificates of deposit and $13 million of U.S.
government and agency securities. The contractual maturities of these agreements are primarily on a continuous and
overnight basis.

remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence
as of June 30, 2015.

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include
reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional
amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.
67Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Foreign Currency
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and
forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and
are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these
foreign exchange contracts sold were $9.8 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, the total
notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign
exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30, 2015,
the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion,
respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold
were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.
Equity
Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed
relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options,
futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may
use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of June 30,
2015, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $2.2 billion
and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.
As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk
were $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated as
hedging instruments.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We
manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-
based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of fixed-
interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total
notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.7 billion and $936 million, respectively.
In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to
agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery
of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the total notional derivative
amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $812 million and $1.1 billion, respectively.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to
facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to
individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of credit contracts
purchased and sold were $618 million and $430 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of
credit contracts purchased and sold were $550 million and $440 million, respectively.
68Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Commodity
We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use
swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures to
broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase
and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of June 30,
2015, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and $316 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion
and $408 million, respectively.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the
standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2015, our long-term unsecured debt rating was
AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

We estimate that $492 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30, 2015 will be reclassified into earnings
within the following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a
result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year 2015.

Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily recognized in
other income (expense), net. These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses) on
derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial for
the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts,

NOTE 9 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Mojang Synergies AB
On November 6, 2014, we acquired Mojang Synergies AB (“Mojang”), the Swedish video game developer of the Minecraft
gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our
gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. Our purchase price allocation is
preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of
assets and liabilities becomes available, including additional information relating to tax matters and finalization of our
valuation of identified intangible assets.
The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8
billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928 million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill
recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Other
segment. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang
has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date.
Nokia’s Devices and Services Business
On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services business (“NDS”)
for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (the “Acquisition”). The purchase price
consisted primarily of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia’s repurchase of convertible notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-
cash transaction, and liabilities assumed of $0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected to accelerate the growth of our D&C
business through faster innovation, synergies, and unified branding and marketing.
The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of March 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and
liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:
(In millions)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset impairment charges related to
our Phone Hardware business. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our
consolidated income statement. See Note 10 – Goodwill and Note 11 – Intangible Assets for additional details.
Our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692
million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.
Following are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the
Acquisition had been consummated on July 1, 2012:

Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013
Revenue $ 96,248 $ 93,243
Net income $ 20,234 $ 20,153
Diluted earnings per share $ 2.41 $ 2.38
These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the
results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments
primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft
and NDS. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of
NDS. Acquisition costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance,
consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses
on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014.
Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint
strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or
loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition, we agreed
to license Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year license as
they are rendered.
Yammer
On July 18, 2012, we acquired Yammer, Inc. (“Yammer”), a leading provider of enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion
in cash. Yammer added an enterprise social networking service to Microsoft’s portfolio of complementary cloud-based
services. The major classes of assets to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and
identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. We assigned the goodwill to Commercial Other under our current segment
structure. Yammer was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the acquisition date.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months.
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the
periods in which the acquisitions occurred.
Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are
presented as “Other” in the above table. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between
business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal year 2015, a $5.1 billion goodwill impairment charge
was included in “Other,” as discussed further below. This goodwill impairment charge was included in impairment,
integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our
table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.
Our accumulated goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $11.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.

PART II
Item 8
Goodwill Impairment
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow
methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow
approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.
Upon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, Phone Hardware goodwill was determined to be impaired. In the
second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and the mix of units
sold had lower margins than planned. These results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation
of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations for the
business. As a result of these changes in strategy and expectations, we have forecasted reductions in unit volume growth
rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in
the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.
Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second
phase of the goodwill impairment test (“Step 2”) was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value
of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, patent
agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill.
The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the
impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and
royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible
assets.
No other instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test. No impairment of goodwill was identified as of
May 1, 2014.

(a) Technology-based intangible assets included $116 million and $98 million as of June 30, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, of net carrying amount of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed.
We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. During fiscal year 2015, we
recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to our Phone Hardware intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2015, we tested the intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with
the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our
testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was
recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income
approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment. These intangible
assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated
income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note
22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. No material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal
year 2014.

Short-term Debt
As of June 30, 2015, we had $5.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest
rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from 8 days to 63 days. As of June 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper
issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 to 91 days. The
estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.
We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on November 4, 2015 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These
credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2015, we were in compliance with
the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No
amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented.
Long-term Debt
As of June 30, 2015, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion,
were $30.3 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-

The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates resulting from
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore,
and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may
not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges. Excluding these losses, our foreign
earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and are generated from our regional operating centers, were
73%, 81%, and 79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In general, other
reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, there were
no individually significant other reconciling items.

permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary

Income taxes paid were $4.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $3.9 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $9.6 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.6 billion,
respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, by
$7.9 billion, $7.0 billion, and $6.5 billion, respectively.
As of June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion,
$1.5 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits
was $237 million, $235 million, and $400 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and was included in
income tax expense.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to
2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain
under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the
audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could
have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do
not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not
anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also
continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2015.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject
to examination for tax years 1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions
of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 14 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Phone Hardware Integration
In July 2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and align NDS with our company’s overall
strategy (the “Phone Hardware Integration Plan”). Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated
approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions
related to the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were completed as of
June 30, 2015.

In connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.3 billion during fiscal year
2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation
and write-downs of certain assets.
Phone Hardware Restructuring
In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our Phone Hardware business to better focus and align
resources (the “Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan”), under which we will eliminate up to 7,800 positions in fiscal year
2016. In connection with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring charges of $780 million
during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily related to contractual
obligations. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan are expected to be completed as of
June 30, 2016.
Restructuring charges associated with each plan were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in
our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by

Indemnifications
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. We evaluate estimated
losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome
and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as
a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our consolidated
financial statements.

Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
Motorola litigation
In October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola Mobility (“Motorola”) with the International
Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by Motorola’s
Android devices. Microsoft and Motorola have filed additional claims against each other with the ITC, in federal district
courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany. The nature of the claims asserted and
status of individual matters are summarized below.
International Trade Commission
In 2012, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order against Motorola on one Microsoft patent, which was affirmed on appeal.
In 2013, Microsoft filed an action in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. seeking an order to compel enforcement of the
ITC’s 2012 import ban against infringing Motorola products by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), after
learning that CBP had failed to fully enforce the order.
In 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft with the ITC alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox
consoles and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing
84Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Xbox products. At Motorola’s request, the ITC terminated its investigation of four Motorola patents. In 2013, the ITC
affirmed there was no violation of the remaining Motorola patent. Motorola appealed the ITC’s decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
U.S. District Court
The Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to Microsoft’s ITC case against
Motorola was stayed pending the outcome of the ITC case.
In November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U.S. District Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola
breached its commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and
non-discriminatory (“RAND”) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential to the implementation of
the H.264 video standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In the Motorola ITC case described above and in suits described
below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U.S. District Courts, in the ITC,
and in Germany. In 2012, the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling that
(1) Motorola had committed to standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents on RAND terms and
conditions; and (2) Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the Seattle District Court set per
unit royalties for Motorola’s H.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial Microsoft liability. In 2013, following
trial of Microsoft’s breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to Microsoft. Motorola appealed with
respect to both the Court’s determination of royalties due Motorola and the jury’s award of damages against Motorola; in
July 2015 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court’s judgment in all respects.
Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one case in Wisconsin initially stayed
and later dismissed without prejudice (a companion case to Motorola’s ITC action), have been transferred to the U.S
District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. The court has stayed these
cases in Seattle on agreement of the parties.
• In the transferred cases, Motorola asserts 15 patents are infringed by a range of Microsoft products including
mobile and PC operating system, productivity, server, communication, browser and gaming products.
• In the Motorola action originally filed in California, Motorola asserts Microsoft violated antitrust laws in connection
with Microsoft’s assertion of patents against Motorola that Microsoft agreed to license to certain qualifying
entities on RAND terms and conditions.
• In counterclaims, Microsoft asserts 14 patents are infringed by Motorola Android devices and certain Motorola
digital video recorders.
Germany
In 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries.
• Motorola asserts two patents (both now expired) are essential to implementation of the H.264 video standard,
and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media Player, and Internet
Explorer infringe those patents. In 2012, the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable Microsoft
products in Germany, which Microsoft appealed. Orders in the litigation pending in Seattle, Washington
described above enjoin Motorola from enforcing the German injunction.
• Motorola asserts that one patent covers certain syncing functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by
Windows Phone 7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange Server, and Hotmail Server. In
2013, the court stayed the case pending the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft is seeking to
invalidate the patent. In 2013, the Federal Patent Court invalidated the originally issued patent claims, but ruled
that certain new amended claims were patentable. Both Motorola and Microsoft appealed. In June 2014, the
court reopened infringement proceedings, which are currently stayed.
• Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any injunction by altering its products to avoid
Motorola’s infringement claims.
• Any damages would be determined in separate proceedings.
85Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft asserts that Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft
patents and is seeking damages and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in Germany issued injunctions on three of the
Microsoft patents, which Motorola appealed. One judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and Motorola has further
appealed), and the other two appeals are pending (in one of these two cases the asserted patent has expired). An
additional infringement proceeding is still pending in the court of first instance. In actions filed separately by Motorola to
invalidate these patents, the Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014 held the Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft
appealed. For the cases in which Microsoft obtained injunctions, if Motorola were to prevail following all appeals, Motorola
could have a claim against Microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted injunction.
IPCom patent litigation
IPCom GmbH & Co. (“IPCom”) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents
spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of
these patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014,
Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the
parties to pursue settlement discussions.
InterDigital patent litigation
InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed four patent
infringement cases against Nokia in the ITC and in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013.
We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same
patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential
functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT is seeking an order excluding importation
of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and
damages. The ITC issued a finding of no violation relating to two of the investigations, which IDT appealed. In February
2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed one of the ITC’s findings; the other has been stayed. In the
third ITC action the administrative law judge (“ALJ”) issued a determination finding: (1) infringement; (2) evidence of
“reverse hold-up;” and (3) the public interest does not preclude issuance of an exclusion order. The ITC is reviewing the
ALJ’s initial determination. The trial in the Delaware case is scheduled for November 2015.
European copyright levies
We assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in various
European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are
based upon a 2001 European Union (“EU”) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted
works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording
devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation
against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that
include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant
cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts
sought in these countries. Since April 2015, we and other major manufacturers have been engaged in settlement
negotiations with the German collecting society, with the aim of concluding negotiations by October 2015.
Other patent and intellectual property claims
In addition to these cases, there are approximately 70 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft.
86Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions
A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in various state, federal, and
Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain
other software products between 1999 and 2005.
We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the U.S. Under the settlements, generally class
members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral
computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to
certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the
state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and
are issued vouchers. We estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $200 million, all of which
had been accrued as of June 30, 2015.
Three similar cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been settled. In 2010, the court
in the British Columbia case certified it as a class action. After the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the case, in
2013 the Canadian Supreme Court reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the British Columbia case, which is
now scheduled for trial in 2016. The other two cases are inactive.
Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims
GO Computer litigation
In June 2005, GO Computer Inc. and co-founder Jerry Kaplan filed a complaint in California state court asserting antitrust
claims under the Cartwright Act related to the business of the former GO Corporation in the early 1990s and its successor
in interest, Lucent Corporation in the early 2000s. All claims prior to June 2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as
barred by the statute of limitations. The case is moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for September 2015.
China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation
In July 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) had begun a
formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices
in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales,
and file verification issues related to Windows and Office software.
Product-Related Litigation
U.S. cell phone litigation
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior
Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused
their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We have assumed responsibility for these claims as part of the NDS
acquisition and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are
consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that
operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are
pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were
manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to
manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.
In September 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general
causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In March 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to
87Table of Contents
PART II
Item 8
preclude plaintiffs’ general causation testimony. In August 2014, the court granted in part defendants’ motion to exclude
plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal. In December 2014, the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals agreed to hear en banc defendants’ interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating expert
scientific evidence. Trial court proceedings are stayed pending resolution of the appeal.
Canadian cell phone class action
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in
the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least
1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and
has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.
Other
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our
business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of June 30, 2015, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $614 million in other current liabilities and $20 million in
other long-term liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could
reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final
outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the
period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with
a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the given
year. Matching contributions for all plans were $454 million, $420 million, and $393 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions in the U.S. plan are invested proportionate
to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the
U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be
invested in Microsoft common stock.
NOTE 22 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, the company’s Chief
Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared
on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segment information in this note is reported on that basis. During the
periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments; D&C Licensing, Computing
and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial Other.
On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note 9 – Business Combinations for additional details. NDS
has been included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. We report the financial performance
of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with
our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with
Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Devices and Consumer
Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect
people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help
advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C segments are:
• D&C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume
licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume
licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”);
Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue.

Item 8
• Computing and Gaming Hardware, comprising: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories,
second-party and third-party video game royalties, and Xbox Live subscriptions (“Xbox Platform”); Surface
devices and accessories (“Surface”); and Microsoft PC accessories.
• Phone Hardware, comprising: Lumia phones and other non-Lumia phones, beginning with our acquisition of
NDS.
• D&C Other, comprising: Resale, consisting of transactions in our Windows Store and Xbox marketplace; search
advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal;
Studios, comprising first-party video games; Mojang; non-Microsoft products sold in our retail stores; and certain
other consumer products and services not included in the categories above.
Commercial
Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and
organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the
user’s hardware and software. Our Commercial segments are:
• Commercial Licensing, comprising: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual
Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); Windows Embedded; volume licensing of
the Windows operating system, excluding academic (“Windows Commercial”); Microsoft Office for business,
including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and related CALs (“Office Commercial”); Microsoft
Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; and Skype.
• Commercial Other, comprising: Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft
Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, other Microsoft Office online
offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure; and certain other commercial products and online
services not included in the categories above.
Revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. Certain revenue contracts are allocated
among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation
based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is
directly charged to our hardware segments. For the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases
and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology.
We do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, Devices
and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are made in
certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by
the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises
or in the cloud.
Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows:
• Sales and marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified
customer segment.
• Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross
margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment
group.
• General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin.
Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segment groups, including costs of: legal, including expenses,
settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and impairment, integration, and
restructuring expenses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation
Redmond, Washington
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated July 31, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.
