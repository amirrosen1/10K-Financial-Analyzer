Item 8
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on
consolidated net income or cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant
influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities are
accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence
over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product
warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product
life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product
returns; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples
of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades
or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome
of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax
returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may
differ from management’s estimates and assumptions.
Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”).
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications;
business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games;
hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related
accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers.
Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,
platforms, and content such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution
support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any
taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
54PART II
Item 8
Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist,
whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the
elements.
Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where
elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the
respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is
recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating
revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best
estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only
allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold
separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will
not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices
would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires
judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances
related to each deliverable.
Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and perpetual
licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.
Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or
significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software product if they license existing versions of
the product during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new product, and
revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the
VSOE of fair value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are based on the price
determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected
to be sold in the near future at the price set by management.
Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they
meet the definition of an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be
deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract customer
support (“PCS”) is being provided, the arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all
revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value
does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as
products are shipped or made available.
Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and upgrades over the life of their
Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we
are unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized ratably
over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges between two to four years.
Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive
unspecified future versions of software products, which we have determined are additional software products and are
therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue
ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to
use unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for as subscriptions,
with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that
allow for the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined period of time without taking
possession of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized
as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made available to customers.
Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount
of storage used in a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of such resources.
Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings
that are accounted for as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However,
because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they
have the same revenue recognition timing.
55PART II
Item 8
Revenue related to Surface devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us, phones, and other hardware components
is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through
Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are
combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties
for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.
Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized
when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed.
Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in
the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price
services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating
costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on
PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support
and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory
valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized
software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the
products.
Product Warranty
We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the
related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected
product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The
specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do
business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For
software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the
software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust
the amounts as necessary.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and
other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also
include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for
international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to
software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is
reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once
technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives
of the products.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions,
trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.5
billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units
(“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over
the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common
stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We
measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using
the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.
56PART II
Item 8
Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is
entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed
earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain
tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year.
The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net
of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes
are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on
the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair
value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. These levels are:
• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our
Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily include U.S. government securities, domestic and international
equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively
traded on exchanges.
• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.
the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where
applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using
market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and
forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level 2 non-derivative investments consist
primarily of foreign government bonds, corporate notes and bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities,
U.S. government and agency securities, common and preferred stock, and certificates of deposit. Our Level
2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.
• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined
using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level
3 non-derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise investments in common and preferred stock, and
goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment
charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are determined
based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market
comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary.
Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying
values.
Financial Instruments
Investments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general,
investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are
classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term
57PART II
Item 8
based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is
available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and
realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding
other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI.
Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific
identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary
impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than
one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted
for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance
sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined
based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an
asset with a corresponding liability.
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value
is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We
employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in
evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate,
among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to
which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the
investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely
than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions
related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance,
changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be
other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the
investment is established.
Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods
of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For
options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives
is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is
recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either
hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
earnings.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily
recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as
commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying
available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-
temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income
(“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.
58PART II
Item 8
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable
balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
(In millions)

Charged to costs and other 85 146 77
Write-offs (106) (55) (43)
Balance, end of period $ 405 $ 426 $ 335
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and
manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities
on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review
indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to
cost of revenue.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property
and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven
years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements,
three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating
segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets
periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that
indicate the asset may be impaired.
Recent Accounting Guidance
Accounting for Income Taxes – Intra-Entity Asset Transfers
In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance requiring an entity to
recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer
occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. This guidance is effective for us beginning July 1,
2018, with early adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2017. We plan to adopt the guidance effective July 1, 2018.
Adoption of the guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. A cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of
income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory and new
deferred tax assets for amounts not recognized under current U.S. GAAP. We anticipate this guidance will have a
material impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, and continue to evaluate any impacts to our
accounting policies, processes, and systems.
59PART II
Item 8
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current U.S.
GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of
reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking
expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to
available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction
in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2020, with early
adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2019. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective
approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently
evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies,
processes, and systems.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase transparency and comparability
among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance
sheet. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by
lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. Under the standard, disclosures are
required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of
cash flows arising from leases. We will be required to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after,
the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach, with certain
practical expedients available.
The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt
the standard effective July 1, 2017 concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue recognition. We
elected the available practical expedients on adoption. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we have
implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information.
The standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, but will not have a material impact on our
consolidated income statements. The most significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities
for operating leases, while our accounting for capital leases remains substantially unchanged.
Adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases
of $6.6 billion and $5.2 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Expected Impacts to Reported Results
below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.
Financial Instruments – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure
In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the
requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through
net income rather than OCI. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018. Adoption of the standard will
be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of
the effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements,
including accounting policies, processes, and systems.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. Under the standard, revenue is
recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration
the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of
the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full
retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the
date of initial application (modified retrospective method). We will adopt the standard using the full retrospective
method to restate each prior reporting period presented.
60PART II
Item 8
The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt
the standard effective July 1, 2017. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented internal controls
and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information and have reached conclusions on key
accounting assessments related to the standard, including our assessment that the impact of accounting for costs
incurred to obtain a contract is immaterial.
The most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for software license revenue. Specifically, for
Windows 10, we will recognize revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably over the life
of the related device. For certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software
licenses and Software Assurance, we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution rather than over
the subscription period. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual
revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms and in some
instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing. Revenue recognition related to our hardware, cloud offerings
such as Office 365, LinkedIn, and professional services will remain substantially unchanged.
Adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of $6.6 billion and $5.8 billion for fiscal year
2017 and 2016, respectively, and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion,
respectively, primarily due to the net change in Windows 10 revenue recognition. In addition, adoption of the standard
will result in an increase in accounts receivable and other current and long-term assets of $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion,
as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by unbilled receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for
certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software
Assurance; a reduction of unearned revenue of $17.8 billion and $11.7 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of license revenue from Windows 10 and certain multi-year commercial
software subscriptions; and an increase in deferred income taxes of $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2017
and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront recognition of revenue. See Expected Impacts to Reported Results below
for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common
stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include
reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible.
Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All
notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents.
65PART II
Item 8
Foreign Currency
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and
forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and
are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional amounts of these
foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total
notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign
exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30,
2017, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $8.8 billion and $10.6
billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and
sold were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively.
Equity
Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is
managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments,
options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our price risk,
we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. As of
June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were
$1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging
instruments. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing
market price risk were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986 million, respectively,
were designated as hedging instruments.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We
manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-
based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of
fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $233 million and $352 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016,
the total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4 billion,
respectively.
In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to
agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical
delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total
notional derivative amounts of mortgage contracts purchased were $567 million and $548 million, respectively.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default
swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices
and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing
exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of credit
contracts purchased and sold were $267 million and $63 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional
amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively.
66PART II
Item 8
Commodity
We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We
use swaps, futures, and option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage exposures
to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to the
purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As
of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased were $19 million. As of June 30, 2016,
the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain
minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral,
similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2017, our long-term
unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was
required to be posted.

NOTE 9 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of LinkedIn Corporation, the
world’s largest professional network on the Internet, for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. The purchase price
consisted primarily of cash of $26.9 billion. The acquisition is expected to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, Office 365,
and Dynamics 365. The financial results of LinkedIn have been included in our consolidated financial statements since
the date of the acquisition.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on

Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods
in which the adjustments are determined.
Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments
are presented as “Other” in the above table. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between
business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.
Our accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30, 2017 and 2016 was $11.3 billion.
Goodwill Impairment
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow
methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash
flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. Effective May 1, 2017, we prospectively
adopted accounting guidance that simplifies our goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to calculate
the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly “Step 2”) in the event that an impairment is identified. Instead, an impairment
charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value.
No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2017 or May 1, 2016 test. During fiscal year 2015, we
recorded impairment charges of $5.1 billion related to goodwill in our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit. Phone
Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit within More Personal Computing under our current segment
structure.
Upon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit goodwill was
determined to be impaired. In the second half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and
revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These results, along with changes in the
competitive marketplace and an evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future
revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of these changes in strategy and expectations, we
forecasted reductions in unit volume growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the
Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an impairment adjustment was required.
74PART II
Item 8
Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, Step 2 of
the goodwill impairment test was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone
Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and
contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair
value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment.
Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates
used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets.

further information.
No material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 2017.
During fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million related to intangible assets in the Devices
reporting unit within our More Personal Computing segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested these
intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic
direction and reduced profitability expectations for our phone business. Based on the results of our testing, we
determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was
recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used the income approach to
determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.
During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to intangible assets in our previous
Phone Hardware reporting unit. Phone Hardware intangible assets are included in the Devices reporting unit under our
current segment structure. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible assets for recoverability
due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability
expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the
intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value
exceeded carrying value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the
intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.
These intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on
our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by
segment in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data.
We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.

Foreign 22,696 20,076 11,144
Income before income taxes $ 23,149 $ 19,751 $ 18,507
In fiscal year 2017, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals related
to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.4 billion and $317 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, income before income
taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.0 billion
and $588 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2015, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and
foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our phone business of $1.1 billion and $8.9
billion, respectively.
The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our
effective rate were as follows:
Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015
Federal statutory rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0%
Effect of:
Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (15.7)% (19.4)% (20.9)%
Phone business losses (7.3)% 1.3% 19.1%
Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation (2.7)% (2.0)% 0%
Domestic production activities deduction (1.4)% (0.6)% (2.4)%
Interest, net 1.8% 1.2% 1.5%
Other reconciling items, net (1.3)% (0.5)% 1.8%
Effective rate 8.4% 15.0% 34.1%
The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in
Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the
U.S. rate, generated 64%, 69%, and 73% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015,
respectively. Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to
previous phone business losses. In general, other reconciling items consist primarily of U.S. state income taxes,
permanent items, and credits. In fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, there were no individually significant other
reconciling items.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the
realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our
income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. The fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included
the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances.

In fiscal year 2017, we corrected the table above to include a $2.5 billion loss carryforward and valuation allowance as
of June 30, 2016. We do not consider this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated
financial statements.
As of June 30, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $13.7 billion, including $11.1 billion of foreign net
operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating
loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or
recovered.
As of June 30, 2017, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary
differences of approximately $142 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are
permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary
differences was approximately $45 billion as of June 30, 2017.
Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $2.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.4 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015,
respectively.
80PART II
Item 8
Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period
intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, were $11.7 billion, $10.2 billion, and $9.6 billion,
respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015,
by $10.2 billion, $8.8 billion, and $7.9 billion, respectively.
As of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $2.3 billion,
$1.9 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax
benefits was $399 million, $163 million, and $237 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and was
included in provision for income taxes.
The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
(In millions)
Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015
Balance, beginning of year $ 10,164 $ 9,599 $ 8,714

Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations (48) (118) (106)
Balance, end of year $ 11,737 $ 10,164 $ 9,599
While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third
quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of
fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for
tax years 2010 to 2016. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to
transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably.
We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment
for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the
information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for
these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain
subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The
resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 14 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
Phone Hardware Restructuring
In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the
“Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan”), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016. In
fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan,
including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously
estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware
Restructuring Plan were completed as of June 30, 2017.
81PART II
Item 8
2016 Restructuring
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management approved restructuring plans that resulted in approximately 4,700
job eliminations in fiscal year 2017, primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales.
In fiscal year 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in connection with the 2016 restructuring plans,
including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. The actions associated with these restructuring plans
were completed as of June 30, 2017.
2017 Restructuring
In June 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. In fiscal year 2017, we recorded
employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. We do
not expect to incur additional charges for this restructuring plan in subsequent years. The actions associated with this
restructuring plan are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.
Restructuring Summary
Restructuring charges associated with each of these plans were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring
expenses on our consolidated income statements, and were reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating

NOTE 17 — CONTINGENCIES
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
IPCom patent litigation
IPCom GmbH & Co. (“IPCom”) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents
spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of
these patents in litigation against Nokia Corporation (“Nokia”) and many of the leading cell phone companies and
operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending
litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions, which continue.
InterDigital patent litigation
InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation (collectively, “IDT”) filed four patent
infringement cases against Nokia in the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and in U.S. District Court for the District
of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We were added to these cases as a defendant after we acquired the Nokia
phone business. Each of the ITC matters was resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in an inter partes review the
United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted
claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT’s appeal of this decision was heard by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April 7, 2017 and the Delaware case was stayed pending final completion of the
inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust
complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act,
alleging unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. Microsoft and IDT settled these cases in May 2017 and
they have been dismissed.
European copyright levies
We assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s alleged failure to pay “private copyright levies” in various
European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies
are based upon a 2001 European Union (“EU”) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of
copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank
media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU
countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating it must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards,
but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that
memory. The most significant cases against Nokia were pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume
of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. We reached a settlement of the Austrian case in August
2016. In Germany, the only period for which settlement has not been reached is 2004 through 2007. In July 2016, the
German Supreme Court heard our appeal contesting the legality of the levy assessed on phones with music players
and over five megabytes of memory. The Supreme Court issued a ruling in December 2016, finding that the levy may
not be appropriate for phones that have the ability to receive music files only via Bluetooth or infrared inputs, and
remanded for further proceedings. A new case schedule has not been set, and we have reached a tentative
settlement.
Other patent and intellectual property claims
In addition to the IPCom cases, there were 41 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30,
2017.
Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions
Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec,
Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft
operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.
The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The plaintiffs filed their case in chief in August 2016,
setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in support of their claims. A six-month oral hearing is scheduled to
commence in September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness affidavits. The Ontario and Quebec cases
are inactive.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims
China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation
In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) had begun a
formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft
offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation relates to compatibility,
bundle sales, file verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and potentially other issues.
Product-Related Litigation
U.S. cell phone litigation
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the
Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets
caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims as part of our
acquisition of Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of
these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are
stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect
claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio
frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their
handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into
effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission
guidelines.
In 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the
basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to
exclude plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for
evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals heard en banc. In October 2016,
the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by defendants and remanding the cases to
the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to reopen discovery and file
additional expert evidence.
Canadian cell phone class action
Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit
filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at
least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June
2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation has been dormant for more than two years.
Other Contingencies
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our
business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of June 30, 2017, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $352 million. While we intend to defend these matters
vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material
adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably
estimable.
85PART II
Item 8
Indemnifications
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have
agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business.
We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of
an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not
encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these
indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 21 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief
Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements
prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial
performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More
Personal Computing.
In December 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation. LinkedIn is reported as part of our
Productivity and Business Processes segment.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Productivity and Business Processes
Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,
communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily
comprises:
• Office Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, comprising Office,
Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and Microsoft Teams, and related Client Access Licenses
(“CALs”).
• Office Consumer, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer
Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.
• LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.
• Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP on-premises, Dynamics CRM on-premises, and
Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and CRM.
90PART II
Item 8
Intelligent Cloud
Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can
power modern business. This segment primarily comprises:
• Server products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio,
System Center, and related CALs, and Azure.
• Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of
end users, developers, and IT professionals across all devices. This segment primarily comprises:
• Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing and other non-volume licensing of
the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows
operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing;
Windows Internet of Things (“IoT”); and MSN display advertising.
• Devices, including Microsoft Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices.
• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services, comprising Xbox Live transactions,
subscriptions, and advertising (“Xbox Live”), video games, and third-party video game royalties.
• Search advertising.
Corporate and Other includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting policies to U.S. GAAP, and impairment,
integration, and restructuring expenses. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to
Windows 10 revenue recognition.
Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our
business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on
certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services,
which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a
profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating
expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple
segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.
In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to
them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines; information technology; human
resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Microsoft Corporation
Redmond, Washington
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2017. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated August 2, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.
