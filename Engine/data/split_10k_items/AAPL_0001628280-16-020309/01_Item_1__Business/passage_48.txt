Company’s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages. Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Employees As of September 24, 2016, the Company had approximately 116,000 full-time equivalent employees. Available Information The Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on
