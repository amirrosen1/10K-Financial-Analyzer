2020 we changed our estimate of the useful life for our servers from three years to four years. The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or $4.06 per basic share
