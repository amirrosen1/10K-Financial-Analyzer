European patent asserted by Motorola in Germany against the ActiveSync protocol. In February 2012, Motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2012, the court ruled that Motorola’s patent is invalid. The court also ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the grant-back clause in Google’s ActiveSync license. Motorola appealed and the appeals court affirmed the lower court’s ruling in Microsoft’s favor in November 2013. Motorola has exhausted all appeals and the rulings in Microsoft’s favor are final.
