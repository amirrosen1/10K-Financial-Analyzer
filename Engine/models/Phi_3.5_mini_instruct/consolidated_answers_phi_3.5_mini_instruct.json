We currently expect a net cumulative-effect adjustment of approximately $550 million, which will reverse the deferral of income tax consequences from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory and new deferred tax assets for\n\namounts not recognized under current GAAP, partially offset by a U.S. deferred tax liability related to global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d). Adoption of the standard is expected to result in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion,\n\nan increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 billion, and a reduction to other current assets of $150 million. As a result of the TCJA, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial\n\nstatements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and\n\nrequires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments.
