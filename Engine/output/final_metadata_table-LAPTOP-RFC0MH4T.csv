The document does not provide a direct comparison to industry benchmarks. However, it does mention that the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This suggests that Apple's EBITDA margin may be lower than industry benchmarks, but this is not explicitly stated in the document.

Therefore, the answer is: EBITDA margin for Apple Inc. in 201","In 2015, Apple Inc.'s operating expenses increased by 24% compared to 2014, with a significant portion of this increase attributed to an increase in research and development (R&D) expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. The growth in R&D expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs, and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.","Based on Apple Inc.'s financial metrics for 2015, the company's total revenue was $229.16 billion. However, the net income and operating income were both reported as $23 billion. This discrepancy suggests that there may have been significant non-operating expenses or gains/losses that affected the net income. The company's EPS was $9.22, total assets were $220.48 billion, stock issuance was 543 million shares, and stock repurchases were $36.024 billion.
