We obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in the United States. Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain\n\nvouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two- 83 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers.

After the trial court dismissed or granted summary judgment on a number of Novell’s claims, trial of the one remaining claim took place in late 2011 and resulted in a mistrial. In July 2012, the\n\ntrial court granted Microsoft’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Novell appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed the trial court’s decision in September 2013. The Supreme Court denied Novell’s petition for review in April 2014.
