The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of\n\n1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. 51Table of Contents PART II Item 7A The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 and for the year ended June 30, 2014: (In millions) June 30, June 30, Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2014 Risk Categories Average High Low Foreign currency $ 179 $ 199 $ 215 $ 287 $ 117 Interest rate $ 73 $ 85 $ 82 $ 91 $ 73 Equity $ 176 $ 181 $ 208 $ 246 $ 173 Commodity $ 17 $ 19 $ 18 $ 21 $ 16 Total\n\none-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $333 million at June 30, 2014 and $350 million at June 30, 2013. The total VaR is 25% less at June 30, 2014, and 28% less at June 30, 2013, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks. 52Table of Contents PART II Item 8 ITEM 8.

See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding: • revenue deferred on certain devices bundled with other products and services (“Bundled Offerings”); and • revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the “Windows Upgrade Offer”). If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction- based products and\n\nservices, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Reportable Segments The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and other. Operating expenses are not allocated to our segments. During the first\n\nquarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. Our reportable segments are described below. On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS for total consideration of $9.5 billion. This amount was greater than the $7.2 billion disclosed previously, primarily due to $1.5 billion of cash acquired, foreign currency movements of $330 million, working capital adjustments of $210 million, and other\n\nadjustments of $260 million. See Note 9 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional details. NDS has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. 29Table of Contents PART II Item\n\n7 Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C segments are: • D&C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue; • Computing and Gaming Hardware, comprising: Xbox gaming and entertainment consoles and accessories, second-party and third-party video game royalties,"
