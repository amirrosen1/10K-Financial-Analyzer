The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured\n\nin the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. 51Table of Contents PART II Item 7A The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 and for the year ended June 30, 2015: (In millions) June 30, June 30, Year Ended June 30, 2015 2014 2015 Risk Categories Average High Low Foreign currency $ 120 $ 179 $ 162 $ 200 $ 107 Interest rate $ 51 $ 73 $ 57 $ 74 $ 48 Equity $ 149 $ 176 $ 161 $ 178 $ 146 Commodity $ 13 $ 17 $ 16 $ 20 $ 11 Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was\n\n$237 million at June 30, 2015 and $333 million at June 30, 2014. The total VaR is 29% less at June 30, 2015, and 25% less at June 30, 2014, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks. 52Table of Contents PART II Item 8 ITEM 8.
