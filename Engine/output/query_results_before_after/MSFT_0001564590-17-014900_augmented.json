        "full_answer": "and foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our phone business of $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Federal statutory rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (15.7)% (19.4)% (20.9)% Phone business losses (7.3)% 1.3% 19.1% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation (2.7)% (2.0)% 0% Domestic production activities deduction (1.4)% (0.6)% (2.4)% Interest, net 1.8% 1.2% 1.5% Other reconciling items, net (1.3)% (0.5)% 1.8% Effective rate 8.4% 15.0% 34.1% The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at\n\nlower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 64%, 69%, and 73% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses. In general, other reconciling items consist primarily of U.S. state income taxes, permanent items, and credits. In fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The decrease in our effective tax rate for\n\nfiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. The fiscal year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges and valuation allowances. 79PART II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: ( In millions) June 30, 2017 2016 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 777 $ 809 Other expense items 1,550 1,609 Restructuring charges 66 284 Unearned revenue 1,889 494 Impaired investments 59 226 Loss carryforwards 4,809 4,252 Depreciation and amortization 53\n\n115 Other revenue items 130 89 Deferred income tax assets 9,333 7,878 Less valuation allowance (3,310) (4,729) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 6,023 $ 3,149 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Foreign earnings $ (1,107) $ (1,242) Unrealized gain on investments and debt (1,384) (2,102) Depreciation and amortization (1,630) (1,008) Other (21) (54) Deferred income tax liabilities (4,142) (4,406) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 1,881 $ (1,257) Reported As Other long-term assets $ 2,412 $ 219 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (531) (1,476) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 1,881 $ (1,257) In fiscal year 2017, we corrected the table above to include a $2.5 billion loss carryforward and valuation allowance as of June 30,\n\n2016. We do not consider this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $13.7 billion, including $11.1 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.

Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to Windows 10 revenue recognition. Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue\n\non certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise\n\ntaxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support.
