Capital Assets The Company’s capital expenditures were $14.9 billion during 2017. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $16.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2018, which\n\nincludes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities. Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had $12.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.20% and maturities generally less than nine months. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 30 As of September 30,\n\n2017, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $104.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2017, the Company repaid $3.5 billion of its Notes upon maturity. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 30, 2017 are as follows (in millions): 2018\n\n$ 6,500 2019 8,863 2020 9,220 2021 7,750 2022 10,297 Thereafter 61,391 Total term debt $ 104,021 Further information regarding the Company’s debt issuances and related hedging activity can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 2, “Financial Instruments” and Note 6, “Debt.” Capital Return Program In May 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the total capital return program from $250 billion to $300 billion, which included an increase in the share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion of the Company’s common stock. Additionally,\n\nthe Company announced that the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2017. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2017, $166 billion of the share repurchase program had been utilized. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with\n\n€1 billion. Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash. These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. During 2017, cash generated by operating activities of $63.6 billion was\n\na result of $48.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $20.8 billion and a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $5.6 billion, which included a one-time payment of $1.9 billion related to a multi-year license agreement. Cash used in investing activities of $46.4 billion during 2017 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $33.1 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $12.5 billion.

The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”). The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the\n\namount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 29 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 30, 2017, September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 268,895 $ 237,585 $ 205,666 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 33,783 $ 27,010 $ 22,471 Commercial paper $ 11,977 $ 8,105 $ 8,499 Total term debt $ 103,703 $ 78,927 $ 55,829 Working capital $ 27,831 $\n\n27,863 $ 8,768 Cash generated by operating activities $ 63,598 $ 65,824 $ 81,266 Cash used in investing activities $ (46,446) $ (45,977) $ (56,274) Cash used in financing activities $ (17,347) $ (20,483) $ (17,716) The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic\n\ncash, cash generated from ongoing U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $252.3 billion and $216.0 billion, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. In connection with the State Aid Decision, Ireland is still computing the recovery amount. The Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission’s announced recovery amount of €13 billion, plus interest of\n\n€1 billion. Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash. These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. During 2017, cash generated by operating activities of $63.6 billion was\n\ncash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements.

The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of\n\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $6.0 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of\n\nthe portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $103.7 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt\n\nare generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016 to increase by $376 million and $271 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.” Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,\n\nchanges in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

In\n\naddition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest\n\nrates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash,\n\ncash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.

Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency-denominated notes, the Company has entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated notes.\n\nA portion of the Company’s Japanese yen-denominated notes is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the carrying value of the debt designated as a net investment hedge was $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. For further discussion regarding the Company’s use of derivative instruments see the Derivative Financial Instruments section of Note 2, “Financial Instruments.” Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 59 The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the\n\ndiscount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $2.2 billion, $1.4 billion and $722 million of interest expense on its term debt for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash. These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 57 Note 6\n\n– Debt Commercial Paper The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the Company had $12.0 billion and $8.1 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with maturities generally less than nine months. The weighted-average interest rate of the Company’s Commercial Paper was 1.20% as of September 30, 2017 and 0.45% as of September 24, 2016. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated\n\nwith the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for 2017 and 2016 (in millions): 2017 2016 Maturities less than 90 days: Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net $ (1,782) $ (869) Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 17,932 3,632 Repayments of commercial paper (12,298) (3,160) Proceeds from/(Repayments of) commercial paper, net 5,634 472 Total change in commercial paper, net $ 3,852 $ (397) Term Debt As of September 30, 2017, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $104.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured\n\nobligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the U.S. dollar-denominated and Australian dollar-denominated floating-rate notes, semi-annually for the U.S. dollar-denominated, Australian dollar-denominated, British pound-denominated, Japanese yen-denominated and Canadian dollar- denominated fixed-rate notes and annually for the euro-denominated and Swiss franc-denominated fixed-rate notes.

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash\n\ncollateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $35 million and $163 million as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, respectively, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects\n\nof collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative assets of $32 million and $160 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables\n\nwith credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had two customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, each of which accounted for 10%. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for\n\n10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 59% and 63% of trade receivables as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 30, 2017, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 42%, 19% and 10%. As of September 24, 2016, the Company"
