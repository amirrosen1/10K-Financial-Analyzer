Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Research and development $ 11,581 15% $ 10,045\n\n25 % $ 8,067 Percentage of total net sales 5% 5% 3% Selling, general and administrative $ 15,261 8% $ 14,194 (1)% $ 14,329 Percentage of total net sales 7% 7% 6% Total operating expenses $ 26,842 11% $ 24,239 8 % $ 22,396 Percentage of total net sales 12% 11% 10% Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2017 and 2016 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position\n\nin the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. Selling, General and Administrative The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and infrastructure-related costs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs, partially offset by an increase in headcount-related expenses. Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as\n\nfollows (dollars in millions): 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Interest and dividend income $ 5,201 $ 3,999 $ 2,921 Interest expense (2,323) (1,456) (733) Other expense, net (133) (1,195) (903) Total other income/(expense), net $ 2,745 104% $ 1,348 5% $ 1,285 The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange-related items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and the\n\nunfavorable impact of foreign exchange-related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.99%, 1.73% and 1.49% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 27 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Provision for income taxes $ 15,738 $ 15,685 $ 19,121 Effective tax rate 24.6% 25.6% 26.4% The Company’s effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory federal income tax\n\nto, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response\n\nto competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.

The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and the\n\nof weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable leverage on fixed costs from lower net sales, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix to services. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 26 The Company anticipates gross margin percentage during the first quarter of 2018 to be between 38.0% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited\n\nto, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins.

Other Income/(Expense), Net Other income/(expense), net for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as\n\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $6.0 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of\n\nthe portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $103.7 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt\n\nare generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016 to increase by $376 million and $271 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.” Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,\n\nchanges in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In\n\naddition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 36 To provide a meaningful assessment of\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest\n\nrates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash,\n\ncash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of\n\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 30, 2017 and September 24, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $6.0 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of\n\nthe portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.

In\n\nused by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products\n\nand similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales\n\nto third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. The following table shows information by\n\nreportable segment for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Americas: Net sales $ 96,600 $ 86,613 $ 93,864 Operating income $ 30,684 $ 28,172 $ 31,186 Europe: Net sales $ 54,938 $ 49,952 $ 50,337 Operating income $ 16,514 $ 15,348 $ 16,527 Greater China: Net sales $ 44,764 $ 48,492 $ 58,715 Operating income $ 17,032 $ 18,835 $ 23,002 Japan: Net sales $ 17,733 $ 16,928 $ 15,706 Operating income $ 8,097 $ 7,165 $ 7,617 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 15,199 $ 13,654 $ 15,093 Operating income $ 5,304 $ 4,781 $\n\n5,518 A reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in millions): 2017 2016 2015 Segment operating income $ 77,631 $ 74,301 $ 83,850 Research and development expense (11,581) (10,045) (8,067) Other corporate expenses, net (4,706) (4,232) (4,553) Total operating income $ 61,344 $ 60,024 $ 71,230 Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 67 The U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives, estimated cost to provide the non-software services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared to the total\n\nselling price of the product. Shipping Costs Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales. Warranty Costs The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates. Apple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 45 Software Development Costs Research and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as\n\nincurred. Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established and as a result software development costs were expensed as incurred. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Share-based Compensation The Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for\n\n(a) equity instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Share-based compensation expense for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company estimates forfeitures expected to occur and recognizes share-based compensation expense for those equity awards expected to vest. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based\n\nRSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance conditions. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on R&D tax credits, foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 9, “Benefit Plans.” Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets"
