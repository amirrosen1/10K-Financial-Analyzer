Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 42 Apple Inc.

The Company’s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple\n\nWatch, AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems, iCloud, Apple Pay and a variety of other accessory, service and support offerings.

In addition, the Company sells a variety of\n\nare expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 44 Share-Based Compensation The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in Note 8, “Benefit Plans.” During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic\n\n718): Improvements to Employee Share- Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which modified certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows. Historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company’s equity awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and were classified as a financing activity in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Beginning in 2018, the Company records any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of\n\nOperations in the reporting periods in which equity vesting occurs. The Company elected to apply the cash flow classification requirements related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to cash generated by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of $627 million and $407 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Earnings Per Share The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Numerator: Net income $ 59,531 $ 48,351 $ 45,687\n\nDenominator: Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 4,955,377 5,217,242 5,470,820 Effect of dilutive securities 44,732 34,450 29,461 Weighted-average diluted shares 5,000,109 5,251,692 5,500,281 Basic earnings per share $ 12.01 $ 9.27 $ 8.35 Diluted earnings per share $ 11.91 $ 9.21 $ 8.31 Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual\n\nmaturity date. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as short-term based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are computed using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including product"
