The total shares withheld were approximately 16.0 million, 15.4 million and 15.9 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $2.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within\n\nthe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.

The Act\n\nlowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company’s provision for income taxes by $1.5 billion during 2018. This increase was composed of $2.0 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and $1.2 billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a $1.7 billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the\n\nCompany’s unrecognized tax benefits. Deferred Tax Balances As a result of the Act, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse, including items for which the related income tax effects were originally recognized in OCI. In addition, the Company elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. Of the $2.0 billion recognized related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities, $1.2 billion is a provisional estimate that incorporates assumptions based upon the\n\nincome — — 59,531 — 59,531 Other comprehensive income/(loss) — — — (3,026) (3,026) Dividends and dividend equivalents declared at $2.72 per share or RSU — — (13,735) — (13,735) Repurchase of common stock (405,549) — (73,056) — (73,056) Share-based compensation — 5,443 — — 5,443 Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 34,334 (1,109) (948) — (2,057) Balances as of September 29, 2018 4,754,986 $ 40,201 $ 70,400 $ (3,454) $ 107,147 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
