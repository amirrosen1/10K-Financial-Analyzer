Note 3\n\n– Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 2018 2017 Land and buildings $ 16,216 $ 13,587 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 65,982 54,210 Leasehold improvements 8,205 7,279 Gross property, plant and equipment 90,403 75,076 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (49,099) (41,293) Total property, plant and equipment, net $ 41,304 $ 33,783 Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 51 Other Non-Current Liabilities 2018 2017 Long-term taxes payable $ 33,589 $ 257 Deferred tax liabilities 426 31,504 Other\n\nnon-current liabilities 11,165 8,654 Total other non-current liabilities $ 45,180 $ 40,415 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): 2018 2017 2016 Interest and dividend income $ 5,686 $ 5,201 $ 3,999 Interest expense (3,240) (2,323) (1,456) Other expense, net (441) (133) (1,195) Total other income/(expense), net $ 2,005 $ 2,745 $ 1,348 Note 4 – Income Taxes U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act\n\nlowered the Company’s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company’s provision for income taxes by $1.5 billion during 2018. This increase was composed of $2.0 billion related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and $1.2 billion associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a $1.7 billion impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the\n\nCompany’s unrecognized tax benefits. Deferred Tax Balances As a result of the Act, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse, including items for which the related income tax effects were originally recognized in OCI. In addition, the Company elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. Of the $2.0 billion recognized related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities, $1.2 billion is a provisional estimate that incorporates assumptions based upon the\n\ndebt $ 4 $ 67 $ (258) Gains/(Losses) reclassified from AOCI into net income – effective portion: Cash flow hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ (482) $ 1,958 $ 885 Interest rate contracts 1 (2) (11) Total $ (481) $ 1,956 $ 874 Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments: Fair value hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ (168) $ — $ — Interest rate contracts (1,363) (810) 341 Total $ (1,531) $ (810) $ 341 Gains/(Losses) related to hedged items: Fair value hedges: Marketable securities $ 167 $ — $ — Fixed-rate debt 1,363 810 (341) Total $ 1,530 $ 810 $ (341) The\n\nfollowing table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 (in millions): 2018 2017 Notional Credit Risk Notional Credit Risk Amount Amount Amount Amount Instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 65,368 $ 1,015 $ 56,156 $ 1,049 Interest rate contracts $ 33,250 $ — $ 33,000 $ 218 Instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 63,062 $ 259 $ 69,774 $ 363 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure\n\nof the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments,\n\nit does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. Apple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | 50 The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements\n\nthat provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 29, 2018, the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion, which was recorded as other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.
