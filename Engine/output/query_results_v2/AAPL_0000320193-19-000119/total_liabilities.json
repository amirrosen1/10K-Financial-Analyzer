The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not\n\nreflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 42 The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for\n\ncollateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 28, 2019, the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.6 billion, which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 29, 2018, the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0\n\nsheet financing arrangements. As of September 28, 2019, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $10.8 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Apple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | 51 Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 28,\n\n2019, are as follows (in millions): 2020 $ 1,306 2021 1,276 2022 1,137 2023 912 2024 834 Thereafter 5,373 Total $ 10,838 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 28, 2019, are as follows (in millions): 2020 $ 2,476 2021 2,386 2022\n\n1,859 2023 1,162 2024 218 Thereafter 110 Total $ 8,211 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material\n\nloss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following matters: VirnetX VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I against the Company and awarded damages of $302 million, which later increased to $440 million in post-trial\n\nproceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I verdict to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and awarded damages of $503 million. VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of the Eastern Texas\n\n224 Change in unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, net of tax: Change in fair value of derivatives (661) 523 1,315 Adjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included in net income 23 382 (1,477) Total change in unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments (638) 905 (162) Change in unrealized gains/losses on marketable securities, net of tax: Change in fair value of marketable securities 3,802 (3,407) (782) Adjustment for net (gains)/losses realized and included in net income 25 1 (64) Total change in unrealized gains/losses on marketable securities 3,827 (3,406) (846) Total other comprehensive income/(loss) 2,781 (3,026) (784) Total comprehensive income $ 58,037\n\n$ 56,505 $ 47,567 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
