To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income. For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on\n\nthe derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period. For derivative instruments designated as a hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its\n\ndefinition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current income. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method, or market. If\n\nthe cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between two to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes\n\neligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $6.9 billion, $5.8 billion and $2.6 billion during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 54 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles,\n\nof and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges.

Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 60 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will\n\nrequire collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 27, 2014, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16%\n\nand the other 13%. As of September 28, 2013, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 13% and the other 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 72% and 68% of trade receivables as of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, respectively. The additions and write-offs to the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were not significant. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing vendors who\n\nmanufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14% of total vendor non- trade receivables as of September 27, 2014 and three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 47%, 21% and 15% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 28, 2013. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as\n\na reduction of cost of sales.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled\n\nwith hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 50 Table of Contents For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products, is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the Company does not\n\ndetermine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded.
