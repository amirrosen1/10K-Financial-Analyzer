Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 32 Table of Contents The Company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2015 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2015 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors\n\nincluding, but not limited to those set forth above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products\n\nwith lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (dollars in millions): 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Research and development $ 6,041 35% $ 4,475 32%\n\n$ 3,381 Percentage of total net sales 3% 3% 2% Selling, general and administrative $11,993 11% $10,830 8% $10,040 Percentage of total net sales 7% 6% 6% Total operating expenses $18,034 18% $15,305 14% $13,421 Percentage of total net sales 10% 9% 9% Research and Development (“R&D”) Expense The year-over-year growth in 2014 and 2013 R&D expense was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs and machinery and equipment to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position\n\nin the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expense The growth in SG&A expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs; higher spending on marketing, advertising and professional services; and the Company’s continued expansion of its Retail segment. The growth in SG&A during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the Company’s continued\n\nincluding, but not limited to those set forth above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph.

The growth in SG&A during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the Company’s continued\n\nexpansion of its Retail segment and increased headcount and related expenses, partially offset by decreased spending on professional services. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 33 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (dollars in millions): 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Interest and dividend income $ 1,795 $ 1,616 $ 1,088 Interest expense (384) (136) 0 Other expense, net (431) (324) (566) Total other income/(expense), net $ 980 (15)% $ 1,156 121% $ 522 The decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was\n\nwith lower gross margins.

Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 33 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (dollars in millions): 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Interest and dividend income $ 1,795 $ 1,616 $ 1,088 Interest expense (384) (136) 0 Other expense, net (431) (324) (566) Total other income/(expense), net $ 980 (15)% $ 1,156 121% $ 522 The decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was\n\ndue primarily to higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income. The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2013 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income resulting from the Company’s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter of 2013 and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the\n\nresult in a $3.4 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 28, 2013, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $2.7 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 42 Table of Contents Debt In April 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue Commercial Paper pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 27, 2014, the\n\nCompany had $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with maturities generally less than nine months. In the third quarters of 2014 and 2013, the Company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. The debt issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. In\n\nthe third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into floating-rate notes, and in the third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes. As of September 27, 2014, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt to increase by $110 million on an annualized basis. Further details regarding the Company’s debt is\n\nprovided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.” Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company\n\nmay enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign\n\nreporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than\n\na portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned\n\non the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. Investments The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of\n\ncredit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would\n\nresult in a $3.4 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 28, 2013, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $2.7 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 42 Table of Contents Debt In April 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue Commercial Paper pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 27, 2014, the\n\nmay enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign\n\ncurrency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation\n\nand management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of September 27, 2014 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of September 28, 2013. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of\n\nthe underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27, 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.

The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than those countries included in the Company’s other operating segments. The results of the Company’s geographic segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment\n\nprovides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales through the Company’s retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally\n\nincluded in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, other separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the Retail segment also includes capital assets. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as\n\ncash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $484 million, $495 million and $858 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company’s total depreciation and amortization was $7.9 billion,\n\n$6.8 billion and $3.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $441 million, $382 million and $319 million was related to the Retail segment in the respective years. Depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant. As the Company continues to expand its business, management believes collaboration across its online, Retail and indirect channels is integral to better serve its customers and optimize its financial results. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, management will be assessing business performance and making decisions on a geographic basis, including the results of its retail\n\nthe Company, and awarded damages of $368 million. On September 16, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision in part, reversed in part, and vacated the damages award. The case has been remanded for further proceedings.
