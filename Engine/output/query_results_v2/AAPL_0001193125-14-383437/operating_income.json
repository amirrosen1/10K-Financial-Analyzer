On September 16, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision in part, reversed in part, and vacated the damages award. The case has been remanded for further proceedings. Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 76 Table of Contents Note 11 – Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its\n\nbusiness primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than those countries included in the Company’s other operating segments. The results of the Company’s geographic segments do not include results of the Retail segment. Each operating segment\n\nprovides similar hardware and software products and similar services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales through the Company’s retail stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally\n\nincluded in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges, other separately managed general and administrative costs and certain manufacturing period expenses. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes. Segment assets include receivables and inventories, and for the Retail segment also includes capital assets. Segment assets exclude corporate assets, such as\n\ncash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were $484 million, $495 million and $858 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company’s total depreciation and amortization was $7.9 billion,\n\nof September 29, 2012 6,574,458 16,422 101,289 499 118,210 Net income 0 0 37,037 0 37,037 Other comprehensive income/(loss) 0 0 0 (970) (970) Dividends and dividend equivalents declared 0 0 (10,676) 0 (10,676) Repurchase of common stock (328,837) 0 (22,950) 0 (22,950) Share-based compensation 0 2,253 0 0 2,253 Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 48,873 (143) (444) 0 (587) Tax benefit from equity awards, including transfer pricing adjustments 0 1,232 0 0 1,232 Balances as of September 28, 2013 6,294,494 19,764 104,256 (471 ) 123,549 Net income 0 0 39,510 0 39,510 Other comprehensive\n\nincome/(loss) 0 0 0 1,553 1,553 Dividends and dividend equivalents declared 0 0 (11,215) 0 (11,215) Repurchase of common stock (488,677) 0 (45,000) 0 (45,000) Share-based compensation 0 2,863 0 0 2,863 Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 60,344 (49) (399) 0 (448) Tax benefit from equity awards, including transfer pricing adjustments 0 735 0 0 735 Balances as of September 27, 2014 5,866,161 $ 23,313 $ 87,152 $ 1,082 $ 111,547 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
