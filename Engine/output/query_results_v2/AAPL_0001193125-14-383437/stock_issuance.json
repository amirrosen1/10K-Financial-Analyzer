Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the\n\ntax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, “Income Taxes” of this Form 10-K for additional information. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income\n\navailable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the\n\nCompany’s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (net income in millions and shares in thousands): 2014 2013 2012 Numerator: Net income $ 39,510 $ 37,037 $ 41,733 Denominator: Weighted-average shares outstanding 6,085,572 6,477,320 6,543,726 Effect of dilutive securities 37,091 44,314 73,757 Weighted-average diluted shares 6,122,663 6,521,634 6,617,483 Basic earnings per share $ 6.49 $ 5.72 $ 6.38 Diluted earnings per share $ 6.45 $ 5.68 $ 6.31 Potentially dilutive securities, the effect of which would\n\nhave been antidilutive, were not significant for 2014, 2013 and 2012. The Company excluded these securities from the computation of diluted earnings per share.
