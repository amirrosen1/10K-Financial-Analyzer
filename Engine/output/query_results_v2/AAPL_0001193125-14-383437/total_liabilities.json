Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 27, 2014, are as follows (in millions): 2015 $ 662 2016 676 2017 645 2018 593 2019 534 Thereafter 1,877 Total $ 4,987 Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 75 Table of Contents Other Commitments The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product\n\nbased on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of September 27, 2014, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $24.5 billion. In addition to the off-balance sheet\n\ncommitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $3.4 billion as of September 27, 2014, which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of\n\na recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al. On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated\n\nparties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930 million. Because the award is now subject to appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in its results of operations. VirnetX, Inc. v. Apple Inc. et al. On August 11, 2010, VirnetX, Inc. filed an action against the Company alleging that certain of its products infringed on four patents relating to network communications technology. On November 6, 2012, a jury returned a verdict against\n\nincome taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper In April 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company intends to use net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 27, 2014, the Company\n\nhad $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities generally less than nine months. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for 2014 (in millions): Maturities less than 90 days: Proceeds from (repayments of) commercial paper, net $1,865 Maturities greater than 90 days: Proceeds from commercial paper 4,771 Repayments of commercial paper (330) Maturities greater than 90 days, net 4,441 Total proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, net $ 6,306 Apple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 66 Table of Contents Long-Term\n\nDebt In the third quarter of 2014 and 2013, the Company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. The debt issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively the “Notes”). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears, quarterly for the floating- rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes.
