Depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the geographic segments was not significant. As the Company continues to expand its business, management believes collaboration across its online, Retail and indirect channels is integral to better serve its customers and optimize its financial results. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, management will be assessing business performance and making decisions on a geographic basis, including the results of its retail\n\nstores in each respective geographic segment. Accordingly, the Company will be changing its reportable segments to align with the way the business is managed. The Company’s reportable operating segments will consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific operations, and the Retail segment will no longer be classified as a separate reportable segment. The historical segment data for prior periods will be reclassified to reflect this change beginning in the Quarterly Report on Form 10- Q for the quarter ending December 27, 2014.
