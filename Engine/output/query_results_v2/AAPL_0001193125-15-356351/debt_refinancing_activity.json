Debt In 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had $8.5 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.14% and maturities generally less than nine months.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company had a total of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company’s total future minimum lease\n\npayments under noncancelable operating leases were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space. Purchase Commitments The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and\n\non the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with\n\nthe primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion incremental decline in the\n\nfair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $56.0 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and\n\nlosses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 to increase by $200 million and $110 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.” Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than\n\nthe U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments\n\nthe primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments\n\nin foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into non- designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.

Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned\n\non the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt.

Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.” Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than\n\nthese financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair\n\nvalues in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of September 26, 2015 and $2.1 billion as of September 27, 2014. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral,\n\nwould be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of $78 million and $549 million, respectively. Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit\n\ninsurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 26, 2015, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 12%. As of September 27, 2014, the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the\n\nother 13%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 71% and 72% of trade receivables as of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2015 and three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 51%,\n\n0 Fixed-rate 1.55% notes 2020 1,250 0.56% 0 0 Fixed-rate 2.15% notes 2022 1,250 0.87% 0 0 Fixed-rate 2.50% notes 2025 1,500 2.60% 0 0 Fixed-rate 3.45% notes 2045 2,000 3.58% 0 0 Second quarter 2015 Swiss franc-denominated debt issuance of SFr1.25 billion: Fixed-rate 0.375% notes 2024 895 0.28% 0 0 Fixed-rate 0.750% notes 2030 384 0.74% 0 0 Third quarter 2015 debt issuance of $8.0 billion: Floating-rate notes 2017 250 0.36% 0 0 Floating-rate notes 2020 500 0.61% 0 0 Fixed-rate 0.900% notes 2017 750 0.35% 0 0 Fixed-rate 2.000% notes 2020 1,250 0.61% 0 0 Fixed-rate 2.700% notes\n\n2022 1,250 0.99% 0 0 Fixed-rate 3.200% notes 2025 2,000 1.22% 0 0 Fixed-rate 4.375% notes 2045 2,000 4.40% 0 0 Third quarter 2015 Japanese yen-denominated debt issuance of ¥250.0 billion: Fixed-rate 0.35% notes 2020 2,081 0.35% 0 0 Fourth quarter 2015 British pound-denominated debt issuance of £1.25 billion: Fixed-rate 3.05% notes 2029 1,148 3.79% 0 0 Fixed-rate 3.60% notes 2042 766 4.51% 0 0 Fourth quarter 2015 Australian dollar-denominated debt issuance of A$2.25 billion: Floating-rate notes 2019 493 1.87% 0 0 Fixed-rate 2.85% notes 2019 282 1.89% 0 0 Fixed-rate 3.70% notes 2022 810 2.79% 0 0 Fourth quarter\n\n2015 euro-denominated debt issuance of €2.0 billion: Fixed-rate 1.375% notes 2024 1,113 3.30% 0 0 Fixed-rate 2.000% notes 2027 1,113 3.85% 0 0 Total term debt 55,701 29,000 Unamortized discount (114) (52) Hedge accounting fair value adjustments 376 39 Less: Current portion of long-term debt (2,500) 0 Total long-term debt $ 53,463 $ 28,987 To manage foreign currency risk associated with the euro-denominated notes issued in the first quarter of 2015 and the British pound-denominated, Australian dollar-denominated and euro-denominated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company entered into currency swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.5\n\nbillion, $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, which effectively converted these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated notes.

To manage interest rate risk on the U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in the third quarter of 2015 and maturing in 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2025, the Company entered into interest rate\n\nswaps with an aggregate notional amount of $4.3 billion. These interest rate swaps effectively converted the fixed interest rates on the U.S. dollar-denominated notes to a floating interest rate. As of September 26, 2015, ¥250.0 billion of the Japanese yen-denominated notes was designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in a foreign operation.

The opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The Company believes the European Commission’s assertions are without merit. If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, the European Commission could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be material, as of September 26, 2015 the Company is unable to estimate the\n\nimpact. Note 6 – Debt Commercial Paper In 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company intends to use net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the Company had $8.5 billion and $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.14% and 0.12%, respectively, and maturities generally less than nine months.
