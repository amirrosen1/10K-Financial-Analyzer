Basis of Presentation and Preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nwell as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period. For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to\n\nchanges in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period. Apple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 47 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that\n\nmay affect the customers’ ability to pay. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period.

The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $9.2 billion, $6.9 billion and $5.8\n\nbillion during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
