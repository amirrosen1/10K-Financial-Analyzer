Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral\n\nfrom its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or\n\nmore of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10% and 12%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 63% and 71% of trade receivables as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Company’s vendors accounted for 47% and 21% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 24, 2016\n\nand three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2015. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 53 Note 3 – Consolidated Financial Statement Details The following tables show the Company’s consolidated financial statement details as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 (in millions): Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 2016 2015 Land and buildings $ 10,185 $ 6,956 Machinery, equipment and internal-use software 44,543 37,038 Leasehold improvements 6,517 5,263 Gross property, plant and equipment 61,245 49,257 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (34,235) (26,786) Total property, plant and\n\nequipment, net $ 27,010 $ 22,471 Other Non-Current Liabilities 2016 2015 Deferred tax liabilities $ 26,019 $ 24,062 Other non-current liabilities 10,055 9,365 Total other non-current liabilities $ 36,074 $ 33,427 Other Income/(Expense), Net The following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Interest and dividend income $ 3,999 $ 2,921 $ 1,795 Interest expense (1,456) (733) (384) Other expense, net (1,195) (903) (431) Total other income/(expense), net $ 1,348 $ 1,285 $ 980 Note 4 – Acquired Intangible Assets The Company’s acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives\n\nasset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period. For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as\n\na foreign currency translation adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period. Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 47 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors, including historical\n\nexperience, age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’ abilities to pay. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company’s inventories consist primarily of finished goods. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by\n\nuse of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one to five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease terms or useful life for leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range\n\nfrom three to five years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $8.3 billion, $9.2 billion and $6.9 billion during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component prepayments and identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, for impairment. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows\n\ntransactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually\n\nestablished thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was $163 million as of September 24, 2016 and $1.0 billion as of September 26, 2015, which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of\n\nSeptember 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, resulting in a net derivative asset of $160 million and a net derivative liability of $78 million, respectively.
