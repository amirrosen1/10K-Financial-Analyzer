Capital Assets The Company’s capital expenditures were $12.8 billion during 2016. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $16.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2017, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment;\n\ndata centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities. Debt The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September 24, 2016, the Company had $8.1 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.45% and maturities generally less than nine months. As of September 24, 2016, the Company has outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate\n\nprincipal amount of $78.4 billion (collectively the “Notes”). During 2016, the Company repaid $2.5 billion of its Notes upon maturity. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes. The future principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of September 24, 2016 are as follows (in millions): 2017 $ 3,500 2018 6,500 2019 6,834 2020 6,454 2021 7,750 Thereafter 47,346 Total term debt $\n\nshare repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 29 As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $216.0 billion and $186.9 billion, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. In connection with the State Aid Decision, the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up\n\nto €13 billion, plus interest. The actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company’s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.\n\nDuring 2016, cash generated from operating activities of $65.8 billion was a result of $45.7 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $19.7 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $484 million.

Capital Assets The Company’s capital expenditures were $12.8 billion during 2016. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $16.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2017, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment;\n\nCustomers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (“ASU 2016-08”); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”); and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (“ASU 2016-12”). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”). The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in\n\nits first quarter of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company does not expect adoption of the new revenue standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September 24, 2016, September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 237,585 $ 205,666 $ 155,239 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 27,010 $ 22,471 $ 20,624 Commercial paper $ 8,105 $ 8,499 $ 6,308 Total term\n\ndebt $ 78,927 $ 55,829 $ 28,987 Working capital $ 27,863 $ 8,768 $ 5,083 Cash generated by operating activities $ 65,824 $ 81,266 $ 59,713 Cash used in investing activities $ (45,977) $ (56,274) $ (22,579) Cash used in financing activities $ (20,483) $ (17,716) $ (37,549) The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the\n\nshare repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings.

The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ItemQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 7A. Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest\n\nrates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company’s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash,\n\ncash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company’s debt. The Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of\n\nminimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of\n\nthe portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $78.9 billion and $55.8 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments.

Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on these instruments\n\nare generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company’s debt as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 to increase by $271 million and $200 million on an annualized basis, respectively. Further details regarding the Company’s debt is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, “Debt.” Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly,\n\nchanges in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In\n\naddition, the Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into non- designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company’s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.
