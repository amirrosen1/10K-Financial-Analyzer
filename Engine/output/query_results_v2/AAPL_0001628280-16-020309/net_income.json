Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each\n\nsegment excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as R&D, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

There was no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014. Net sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014 and long-lived assets as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 are as\n\nfollows (in millions): 2016 2015 2014 Net sales: U.S. $ 75,667 $ 81,732 $ 68,909 China (1) 46,349 56,547 30,638 Other countries 93,623 95,436 83,248 Total net sales $ 215,639 $ 233,715 $ 182,795 2016 2015 Long-lived assets: U.S. $ 16,364 $ 12,022 China (1) 7,807 8,722 Other countries 2,839 3,040 Total long-lived assets $ 27,010 $ 23,784 (1) China includes Hong Kong.

Net sales by product for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in millions):\n\nnature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 ended on September 24,\n\n2016, September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively, and each spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every five or six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will next occur in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2017. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. During 2016, the Company adopted an accounting standard that simplified the presentation of deferred income\n\ntaxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The Company has adopted this accounting standard prospectively; accordingly, the prior period amounts in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within this Annual Report on Form 10-K were not adjusted to conform to the new accounting standard. The adoption of this accounting standard was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive\n\nevidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of\n\nloss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software\n\nand dividend equivalents declared — — (12,188) — (12,188) Repurchase of common stock (279,609) — (29,000) — (29,000) Share-based compensation — 4,262 — — 4,262 Common stock issued, net of shares withheld for employee taxes 37,022 (806) (419) — (1,225) Tax benefit from equity awards, including transfer pricing adjustments — 379 — — 379 Balances as of September 24, 2016 5,336,166 $ 31,251 $ 96,364 $ 634 $ 128,249 See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
