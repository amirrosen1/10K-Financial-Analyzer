The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five years. The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally\n\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than\n\nnot it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment’s cost basis. As of September 24, 2016, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than- temporarily impaired. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive\n\nfollows: Dividends Amount Per Share (in millions) 2016: Fourth quarter $ 0.57 $ 3,071 Third quarter 0.57 3,117 Second quarter 0.52 2,879 First quarter 0.52 2,898 Total cash dividends declared and paid $ 2.18 $ 11,965 2015: Fourth quarter $ 0.52 $ 2,950 Third quarter 0.52 2,997 Second quarter 0.47 2,734 First quarter 0.47 2,750 Total cash dividends declared and paid $ 1.98 $ 11,431 Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Share Repurchase Program In April 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion of the\n\nCompany’s common stock, of which $133 billion had been utilized as of September 24, 2016. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Apple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 60 The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (“ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver\n\nshares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a\n\nrepurchase of common stock in the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.
