Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $6.3 billion, $8.2 billion, and $11.0 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant\n\nand recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture\n\nexperience and employee level. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, and expenses related to legal settlements. 44 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of adjustments to and gains on equity securities of $18 million, $145 million, and $231 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019, equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $109 million, $(131) million, and $11 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019, and foreign currency gains (losses) of $247 million, $(206) million, and $(20) million in 2017, 2018,\n\nand 2019. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\n\nliabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.
