CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (in millions, except per share data) December 31, 2019 2020 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $\n\n2020 we changed our estimate of the useful life for our servers from three years to four years. The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 billion and an increase in net income of $2.0 billion, or $4.06 per basic share\n\nand $3.98 per diluted share. 43 Table of Contents Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Cash paid for interest on debt $ 854 $ 875 $ 916 Cash paid for operating leases $ — $ 3,361 $ 4,475 Cash paid for interest on finance leases $ 381 $ 647 $ 612 Cash paid for interest on financing obligations $ 194 $ 39 $ 102 Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 1,184 $ 881 $ 1,713 Assets acquired under\n\noperating leases $ — $ 7,870 $ 16,217 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases $ 10,615 $ 13,723 $ 11,588 Property and equipment acquired under build-to-suit arrangements $ 3,641 $ 1,362 $ 2,267 Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an\n\nantidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 487 494 500 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 10 10 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 500 504 510 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have\n\nmultiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.
