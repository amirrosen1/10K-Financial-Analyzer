These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We\n\nallocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. 64 Table of\n\nContents North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The\n\nAWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start- ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions. Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 North America Net sales $ 141,366 $ 170,773 $ 236,282 Operating expenses 134,099 163,740 227,631 Operating income $ 7,267 $ 7,033 $ 8,651 International Net sales $ 65,866 $ 74,723 $ 104,412 Operating expenses 68,008 76,416 103,695 Operating income (loss) $ (2,142) $ (1,693) $ 717 AWS Net sales $ 25,655 $\n\n35,026 $ 45,370 Operating expenses 18,359 25,825 31,839 Operating income $ 7,296 $ 9,201 $ 13,531 Consolidated Net sales $ 232,887 $ 280,522 $ 386,064 Operating expenses 220,466 265,981 363,165 Operating income 12,421 14,541 22,899 Total non-operating income (expense) (1,160) (565) 1,279 Provision for income taxes (1,197) (2,374) (2,863) Equity-method investment activity, net of tax 9 (14) 16 Net income $ 10,073 $ 11,588 $ 21,331 65\n\nliabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $50.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.4 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can\n\nextend beyond the original contractual term. Other Long-Term Liabilities Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, deferred tax liabilities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries\n\nare translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates 50 Table of Contents prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the\n\nsettlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $(186) million, $95 million, and $118 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that\n\nare measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2019 Cost or Gross Gross Total Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Cash $ 9,776 $ — $ — $ 9,776 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 18,850 — — 18,850 Equity securities 202 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 4,794 — — 4,794 U.S. government and agency securities 7,070 11 (1) 7,080 Corporate debt securities 11,845 37 (1) 11,881 Asset-backed securities 2,355 6 (1) 2,360 Other fixed income securities 393 1 — 394\n\n— % — % — % — % — % (0.16)% Corporate debt securities 16,505 4,459 5,531 1,990 886 — 29,371 29,988 Weighted average interest rate 0.42 % 1.65 % 1.32 % 1.86 % 1.84 % 0.92 % U.S. government and agency securities 5,439 587 899 298 67 71 7,361 7,439 Weighted average interest rate 0.30 % 1.38 % 1.12 % 1.74 % 1.13 % 2.97 % 0.58 % Asset-backed securities 870 773 472 763 243 46 3,167 3,235 Weighted average interest rate 2.08 % 2.00 % 1.53 % 2.13 % 1.57 % 1.25 % 1.94 % Foreign government and\n\nagency securities 4,932 147 45 3 — — 5,127 5,131 Weighted average interest rate 0.25 % 0.74 % 1.28 % 1.76 % — % — % 0.28 % Other fixed income securities 109 156 230 160 43 — 698 710 Weighted average interest rate 2.10 % 1.85 % 1.10 % 0.84 % 1.31 % — % 1.38 % $ 55,285 $ 6,122 $ 7,177 $ 3,214 $ 1,239 $ 117 $ 73,154 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 73,933 As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term debt with a face value of $33.2 billion, including the current\n\nportion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2020, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances\n\nassociated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.7 billion in comparison with the prior year. 33 Table of Contents We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\n\n(“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2020, of $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.2 billion, $2.4 billion, and $4.7 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.
