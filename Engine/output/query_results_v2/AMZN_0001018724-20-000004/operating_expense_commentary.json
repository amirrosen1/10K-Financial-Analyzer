    "combined_text": "operating income by $23 million and $8 million for 2019 and 2020. The International operating income in 2020, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We expect International operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $(116) million and $411 million for 2019\n\nand 2020. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $273 million and $30 million for 2019 and 2020. 26\n\nTable of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 165,536 $ 233,307 Fulfillment 40,232 58,517 Technology and content 35,931 42,740 Marketing 18,878 22,008 General and administrative 5,203 6,668 Other operating expense (income), net 201 (75) Total operating expenses $ 265,981 $ 363,165 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales 19 % 41 % Fulfillment 18 45 Technology and content 25 19 Marketing 37 17 General and administrative 20 28 Other operating expense (income), net (32) (137) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 59.0\n\n% 60.4 % Fulfillment 14.3 15.2 Technology and content 12.8 11.1 Marketing 6.7 5.7 General and administrative 1.9 1.7 Other operating expense (income), net 0.1 — Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping\n\ncosts resulting from increased sales. We expect cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $37.9 billion and $61.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at\n\nPart II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth\n\nin sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of COVID-19. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not\n\nincluded in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. 28 Table of Contents General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $201 million and $(75) million during 2019 and 2020, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset\n\nby a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $832 million and $555 million during 2019 and 2020. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA- rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $1.6 billion in 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. Our long-term\n\nlease liabilities were $39.8 billion and $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our long-term debt was $23.4 billion and $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $203 million and $2.4 billion during 2019 and 2020. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity warrant valuations, equity securities valuations and adjustments, and foreign currency.

Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,\n\nand to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity\n\nof a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of valuations and adjustments of equity securities of $145 million, $231 million, and $833 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020, equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $(131) million, $11 million, and $1.5 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and foreign currency gains (losses) of $(206) million, $(20) million, and $35 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020. During the period from January 1, 2021 to February 2, 2021, we expect to\n\nrecord upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies of approximately $1.5 billion. In addition, for this same period, our equity and equity warrant investments in public companies, which are subject to volatility based on changes in market prices, have experienced gains of approximately $1.5 billion based on available trading prices. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of\n\nour foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred\n\n2020 we changed our estimate of the useful life for our servers from three years to four years. The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an\n\nantidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 487 494 500 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 10 10 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 500 504 510 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have\n\nmultiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.
