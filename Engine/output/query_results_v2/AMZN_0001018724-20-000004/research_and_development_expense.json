    "combined_text": "operating income by $23 million and $8 million for 2019 and 2020. The International operating income in 2020, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We expect International operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $(116) million and $411 million for 2019\n\nand 2020. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $273 million and $30 million for 2019 and 2020. 26\n\nTable of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 165,536 $ 233,307 Fulfillment 40,232 58,517 Technology and content 35,931 42,740 Marketing 18,878 22,008 General and administrative 5,203 6,668 Other operating expense (income), net 201 (75) Total operating expenses $ 265,981 $ 363,165 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales 19 % 41 % Fulfillment 18 45 Technology and content 25 19 Marketing 37 17 General and administrative 20 28 Other operating expense (income), net (32) (137) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 59.0\n\n% 60.4 % Fulfillment 14.3 15.2 Technology and content 12.8 11.1 Marketing 6.7 5.7 General and administrative 1.9 1.7 Other operating expense (income), net 0.1 — Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping\n\ncosts resulting from increased sales. We expect cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $37.9 billion and $61.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at\n\nthe extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions. The increase in\n\nfulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, costs from expanding our fulfillment network, and the COVID-19 related impact of lower productivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces. We expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment\n\nvolumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and\n\nother Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to\n\nincrease over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure, offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers. See Item 8 of\n\nvolumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.

See Item 8 of\n\nPart II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth\n\nin sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of COVID-19. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not\n\nbusinesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021\n\nto date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations. First Quarter 2021 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow between 33% and 40% compared with first quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between\n\n$3.0 billion and $6.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020. This guidance assumes approximately $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 32\n\nobligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of\n\nproperty and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044) Free cash flow 25,825 31,020 Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (12,916) (9,104) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (392) (427) Principal repayments of financing obligations (27) (53) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ 12,490 $ 21,436 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104) ___________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this\n\namount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million and $11,588 million. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,628 million and $10,642 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or\n\ncash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 31 Table of Contents Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable\n\nprior year periods. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Exchange At Prior Exchange At Prior As Rate Year As Rate Year Reported Effect (1) Rates (2) Reported Effect (1) Rates (2) Net sales $ 280,522 $ 2,560 $283,082 $ 386,064 $ (1,438) $ 384,626 Operating expenses 265,981 2,740 268,721 363,165 (989) 362,176 Operating income 14,541 (180) 14,361 22,899 (449) 22,450 ___________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing\n\nobligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of\n\nproperty and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044) Free cash flow 25,825 31,020 Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (12,916) (9,104) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (392) (427) Principal repayments of financing obligations (27) (53) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ 12,490 $ 21,436 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104) ___________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this\n\nprovide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other”\n\non our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, customer receivables, net, were $12.6 billion and $14.8 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $863 million and $381 million. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual\n\npayments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $495 million, $718 million, and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additions to the allowance were $878 million, $1.0 billion, and $1.4 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $731 million, $793 million, and $1.0 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. 47 Table of Contents Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not\n\nsignificant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment.\n\nDepreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years prior to January 1, 2020 and four years subsequent to January 1, 2020 for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating\n\ninvolved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred. Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of advertising\n\nand payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $8.2 billion, $11.0 billion, and $10.9 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. 45 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses;\n\nfacilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment,\n\nand to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity\n\nof a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of valuations and adjustments of equity securities of $145 million, $231 million, and $833 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020, equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $(131) million, $11 million, and $1.5 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and foreign currency gains (losses) of $(206) million, $(20) million, and $35 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume\n\nrebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those\n\ncosts incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.
