Expected future amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is as\n\nfollows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 $ 464 2022 430 2023 368 2024 303 2025 251 Thereafter 2,022 $ 3,838 Note 6 — DEBT As of December 31, 2020, we had $32.2 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the “Notes”), including $10.0 billion issued in June 2020 for general corporate purposes. We also have other long-term debt and borrowings under our credit facility of $1.6 billion and $924 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our total long-term debt obligations are as follows (in millions): Stated Interest Effective Interest Maturities (1) Rates Rates December 31, 2019 December\n\n$1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, of which $1.1 billion was capitalized to in-process research and development intangible assets (“IPR&D”). The primary reason for all acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of 2020 acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. 54 Table of Contents Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as\n\nsales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

Expected future amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is as\n\nFinance lease liabilities, including interest 10,778 7,246 3,456 1,389 1,035 6,533 30,437 Financing obligations, including interest 227 230 233 237 240 3,751 4,918 Leases not yet commenced 1,010 1,738 1,876 1,973 1,951 20,321 28,869 Unconditional purchase obligations (1) 3,869 3,760 3,367 3,141 2,213 136 16,486 Other commitments (2)(3) 3,671 2,386 945 783 661 8,351 16,797 Total commitments $ 27,342 $ 23,166 $ 17,839 $ 16,151 $13,109 $ 97,102 $194,709 ___________________ (1) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores and long- term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not\n\nreflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction, asset retirement obligations, and liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater\n\nthan one year. (3) Excludes approximately $2.8 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged or otherwise restricted $994 million and $875 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third- party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our\n\nCredit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.” Suppliers During 2020, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax\n\nliabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third- party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other"
