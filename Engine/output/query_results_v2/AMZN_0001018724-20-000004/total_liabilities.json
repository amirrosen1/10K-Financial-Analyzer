The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in\n\nthis matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular 59 Table of Contents basis, developments in our legal proceedings and\n\nother contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and\n\nassumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See also “Note 9 — Income Taxes.” Note 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock We have authorized 500 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. No preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 507 million, 512 million, and 518 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. These totals\n\ninclude all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock Repurchase Activity In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2018, 2019, or 2020. Stock Award Plans Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years. Stock Award Activity Stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Cost of sales $ 73 $\n\ninterest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. 46 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other\n\nthan quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\n\nliabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these warrants had a fair value of $669 million and $3.0 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated\n\nbalance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales\n\nto individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write- down of inventory, was $1.6 billion and $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to\n\n23,414 $ 31,816 ___________________ (1) The weighted average remaining lives of the 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020 Notes were 1.9, 11.8, 16.2, and 18.7 years as of December 31, 2020. The combined weighted average remaining life of the Notes was 15.8 years as of December 31, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $26.2 billion and\n\n$37.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we subsequently increased to $740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.40%, and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There\n\nwere $740 million and $338 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which had a weighted- average interest rate of 3.4% and 3.0%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged $852 million and $398 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Other long-term debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate\n\nof 4.1% and 2.9% as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business operations. The estimated fair value of other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. 56 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2020, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 $ 1,156 2022 1,629 2023 2,283 2024 3,355 2025 2,251 Thereafter 22,500 $ 33,174 In April 2018, we established\n\na commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In June 2020, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Program to $10.0 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2019. There were $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2020, which are included in “Accrued expenses"
