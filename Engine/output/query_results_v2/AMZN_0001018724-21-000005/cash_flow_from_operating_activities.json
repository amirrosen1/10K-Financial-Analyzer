We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation methodologies and assumptions, including the determination of\n\nforecasts of income or loss, and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Actual results could differ materially\n\nfrom these estimates. For example, in Q4 2021 we completed a useful life study for our servers and networking equipment and are increasing the useful lives from four years to five years for servers and from five years to six years for networking equipment in January 2022, which, based on servers and networking equipment that are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2021, will have an anticipated impact to our 2022 operating income of $3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from three years to four years in January 2020.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method.
