Technology infrastructure assets are allocated among the segments based on usage, with the majority allocated to the AWS segment. Total segment assets reconciled to consolidated amounts are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2019 2020 2021 North America (1) $ 72,277\n\n$ 108,405 $ 161,255 International (1) 30,709 42,212 57,983 AWS (2) 36,500 47,574 63,835 Corporate 85,762 123,004 137,476 Consolidated $ 225,248 $ 321,195 $ 420,549 ___________________ (1) North America and International segment assets primarily consist of property and equipment, operating leases, inventory, and accounts receivable.

Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $80.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. The weighted average remaining life of our long- term contracts is 3.8 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual\n\nterm. Other Long-Term Liabilities Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, deferred tax liabilities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars\n\nat period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains\n\n(losses) of $(95) million, $(118) million, and $19 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021. 49 Table of Contents Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured\n\nat fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2020 Cost or Gross Gross Total Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Cash $ 10,063 $ — $ — $ 10,063 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 27,430 — — 27,430 Equity securities (1) 617 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 5,130 1 — 5,131 U.S. government and agency securities 7,410 30 (1) 7,439 Corporate debt securities 29,684 305 (1) 29,988 Asset-backed securities 3,206 32 (3) 3,235 Other fixed income securities 701 9 — 710 Equity\n\namounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range\n\nof possible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments.\n\nThese segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers\n\nin the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions. 64 Table of Contents Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 North America Net sales $ 170,773 $ 236,282 $ 279,833 Operating expenses 163,740 227,631 272,562 Operating income $ 7,033 $ 8,651 $ 7,271 International Net sales $ 74,723 $ 104,412 $\n\n127,787 Operating expenses 76,416 103,695 128,711 Operating income (loss) $ (1,693) $ 717 $ (924) AWS Net sales $ 35,026 $ 45,370 $ 62,202 Operating expenses 25,825 31,839 43,670 Operating income $ 9,201 $ 13,531 $ 18,532 Consolidated Net sales $ 280,522 $ 386,064 $ 469,822 Operating expenses 265,981 363,165 444,943 Operating income 14,541 22,899 24,879 Total non-operating income (expense) (565) 1,279 13,272 Provision for income taxes (2,374) (2,863) (4,791) Equity-method investment activity, net of tax (14) 16 4 Net income $ 11,588 $ 21,331 $ 33,364 Net sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar"
