Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $8 million and $88 million for 2020 and 2021. The International operating loss in 2021, as compared to the operating income in the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives,\n\nand increased carrier rates, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $411 million and $435 million for 2020 and 2021. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and\n\nreduced prices for our customers.

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers.

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $61.1\n\nbillion and $76.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices\n\nin the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, which will primarily impact our AWS segment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as\n\nour sponsored search, social and online advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to higher marketing spend, which was constrained in 2020 in response to COVID-19, and increased payroll\n\nand related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees. 26 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $(75) million and $62 million during 2020\n\nand 2021, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in 2020, offset by a lease impairment in 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $555 million and $448 million during 2020 and 2021. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are\n\ninvested. Interest expense was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2020 and 2021 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. Our long-term lease liabilities were $52.6 billion and $67.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Our long-term debt was $31.8 billion and $48.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $2.4 billion and $14.6 billion during 2020 and 2021.

See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. 31 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2021, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of\n\noperations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $3.0 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash\n\nequivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2021, of $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to\n\nour intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.

Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2021, our recorded\n\nvalue in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive, Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The\n\ncurrent global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.
