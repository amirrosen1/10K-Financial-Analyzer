Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more\n\nresources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on\n\ntrademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Human Capital Our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As\n\nof December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business. As we strive to be Earth’s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including\n\ncompetitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback. 4 Table of Contents Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected\n\nby factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition\n\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues\n\nto intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well- funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may\n\nnot be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality\n\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services.

Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality\n\nissues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could\n\nharm our business or damage our reputation. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject\n\nthese factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating\n\nprofit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our\n\ncustomers’ demands; • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for,\n\nour current operations and future growth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related\n\nto sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics); • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products; • constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; •\n\nItem 1B.

Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts\n\nand Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the\n\nItem 1B.

We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts\n\nexpect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2022 due to increases\n\nin the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, which will primarily impact our AWS segment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as\n\nour sponsored search, social and online advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to higher marketing spend, which was constrained in 2020 in response to COVID-19, and increased payroll\n\nand related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees. 26 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $(75) million and $62 million during 2020\n\nand 2021, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in 2020, offset by a lease impairment in 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $555 million and $448 million during 2020 and 2021. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are\n\nother risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize\n\nour net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result\n\nfrom increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non- GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our\n\nnon-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related\n\nfacilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle1. On\n\nand any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Net Sales: North America $ 236,282 $ 279,833 International 104,412 127,787 AWS 45,370 62,202 Consolidated $ 386,064 $ 469,822 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 38 % 18 % International 40 22 AWS 30 37 Consolidated 38 22 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America 38 % 18 % International 38 20 AWS 30 37 Consolidated 37 21 Net sales mix: North\n\nAmerica 61 % 60 % International 27 27 AWS 12 13 Consolidated 100 % 100 % Sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $1.4 billion and $3.8 billion for 2020 and 2021. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below. North America sales increased 18% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by\n\nour continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our North America sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. International sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand,\n\npartially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our International sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. AWS sales increased 37% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 23 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss)\n\nby segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Operating Income (Loss): North America $ 8,651 $ 7,271 International 717 (924) AWS 13,531 18,532 Consolidated $ 22,899 $ 24,879 Operating income was $22.9 billion and $24.9 billion for 2020 and 2021. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in\n\nour intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2021, our recorded\n\nvalue in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive, Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The\n\ncurrent global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. 31 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2021, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of\n\noperations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $3.0 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash\n\nequivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2021, of $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to\n\nour intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our\n\ninvestment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise\n\nin interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages): Estimated Fair Value as of December 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total 31, 2021 Money market funds $ 20,312 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 20,312 $ 20,312 Weighted average interest"
