Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more\n\nresources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors.

We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Human Capital Our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As\n\nof December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business. As we strive to be Earth’s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including\n\ncompetitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback. 4 Table of Contents Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including\n\nthe extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings; 9 Table of Contents • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and • disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade\n\ndisputes, and similar events. We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can\n\nbe no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long- zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network currently is being affected by global supply chain constraints and constrained labor markets, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as\n\nwe would like. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time and, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our fulfillment network operating efficiency. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to\n\nsecure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and\n\ncustomers’ demands; • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for,\n\nour current operations and future growth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related\n\nto sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics); • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products; • constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; •\n\nthe extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings; 9 Table of Contents • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and • disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade\n\ndisputes, and similar events.

There can\n\nthese factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating\n\nprofit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our\n\ncustomers’ demands; • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for,\n\nour current operations and future growth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related\n\nto sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics); • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products; • constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; •\n\nItem 1B.

Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle1. On\n\naverage, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales 1 The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 18 Table of Contents by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the\n\nextent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often\n\nsupport a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on\n\nthe Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock\n\nfrom increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non- GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our\n\nnon-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related\n\nfacilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors.

We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often\n\nvary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related\n\ntransaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, increased wage rates and incentives and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock\n\ninventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and\n\nother expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We\n\nexpect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2022 due to increases\n\nour intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2021, our recorded\n\nvalue in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive, Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The\n\ncurrent global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of\n\noperations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $3.0 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash\n\nequivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2021, of $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to\n\nour intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2021, our recorded\n\noperations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2021, our recorded\n\nvalue in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive, Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The\n\ncurrent global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.
