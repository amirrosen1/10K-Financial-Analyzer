We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal\n\nproceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is\n\nimmaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See also “Note 9 — Income Taxes.” Note 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock We have authorized 500 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock.\n\nNo preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 512 million, 518 million, and 523 million, as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. 59 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Activity In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2019, 2020, or 2021. During the period\n\nprovide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period. Advertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to\n\nservices using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. Other - Other revenue includes sales related to various other service offerings, which are recognized as or when those services are performed. Return Allowances Return allowances, which\n\nreduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $712 million, $859 million, and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additions to the allowance were $2.5 billion, $3.5 billion, and $5.1 billion and deductions from the allowance were $2.5 billion, $3.6 billion, and $4.9 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $629 million, $852 million, and $882 million as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, for the rights to recover\n\nproducts from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. 42 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with\n\nseller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and\n\n$ 31,816 $ 48,744 ___________________ (1) The weighted-average remaining lives of the 2012, 2014, 2017, 2020 and 2021 Notes were 0.9, 13.6, 15.2, 17.7 and 14.3 years as of December 31, 2021. The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 14.9 years as of December 31, 2021. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $37.7 billion\n\nand $53.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. We have a $1.0 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we increased from $740 million in November 2021 and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.40%, and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There were\n\n$338 million and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.0% and 2.7%, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we have pledged $398 million and $918 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.

There were $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2020 and\n\n2021, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including 56 Table of Contents issuance costs, of 0.11% and 0.08%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. We also have a $7.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders with a term that extends to June 2023, which was amended in November 2021 to replace LIBOR as the applicable benchmark rate for loans denominated in certain foreign currencies (the “Credit Agreement”).
