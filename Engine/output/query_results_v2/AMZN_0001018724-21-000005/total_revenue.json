Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments.\n\nThese segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers\n\nin the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions. 64 Table of Contents Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 North America Net sales $ 170,773 $ 236,282 $ 279,833 Operating expenses 163,740 227,631 272,562 Operating income $ 7,033 $ 8,651 $ 7,271 International Net sales $ 74,723 $ 104,412 $\n\n127,787 Operating expenses 76,416 103,695 128,711 Operating income (loss) $ (1,693) $ 717 $ (924) AWS Net sales $ 35,026 $ 45,370 $ 62,202 Operating expenses 25,825 31,839 43,670 Operating income $ 9,201 $ 13,531 $ 18,532 Consolidated Net sales $ 280,522 $ 386,064 $ 469,822 Operating expenses 265,981 363,165 444,943 Operating income 14,541 22,899 24,879 Total non-operating income (expense) (565) 1,279 13,272 Provision for income taxes (2,374) (2,863) (4,791) Equity-method investment activity, net of tax (14) 16 4 Net income $ 11,588 $ 21,331 $ 33,364 Net sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar\n\neconomic characteristics, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Net Sales: Online stores (1) $ 141,247 $ 197,346 $ 222,075 Physical stores (2) 17,192 16,227 17,075 Third-party seller services (3) 53,762 80,461 103,366 Subscription services (4) 19,210 25,207 31,768 Advertising services (5) 12,625 19,773 31,160 AWS 35,026 45,370 62,202 Other (6) 1,460 1,680 2,176 Consolidated $ 280,522 $ 386,064 $ 469,822 ___________________ (1) Includes product sales and digital media content where we record revenue gross.
