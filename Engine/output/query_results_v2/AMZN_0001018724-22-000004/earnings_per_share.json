Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock\n\nawards as determined under the treasury stock method.

Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions.
