Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating loss by $857 million in 2022. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and cost structure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our\n\nchange in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $1.4 billion in 2022. 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 272,344 $ 288,831 Fulfillment 75,111 84,299 Technology and content 56,052 73,213 Sales and marketing 32,551 42,238 General and administrative\n\n8,823 11,891 Other operating expense (income), net 62 1,263 Total operating expenses $ 444,943 $ 501,735 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline): Cost of sales 17 % 6 % Fulfillment 28 12 Technology and content 31 31 Sales and marketing 48 30 General and administrative 32 35 Other operating expense (income), net (183) 1,936 Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 58.0 % 56.2 % Fulfillment 16.0 16.4 Technology and content 11.9 14.2 Sales and marketing 6.9 8.2 General and administrative 1.9 2.3 Other operating expense (income), net 0.0 0.2 Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price\n\nof consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and product costs resulting from increased sales and increases in investments in our fulfillment network, transportation costs, and wage rates and incentives. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $10.8 billion in 2022. Shipping costs to receive\n\nproducts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $76.7 billion and $83.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our\n\nof Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased\n\ncompetition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities and higher marketing spend. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them\n\nindefinitely. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees. 26 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $62 million and $1.3 billion during 2021 and 2022, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets and, for 2022, $1.1 billion of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $448 million and $989 million during 2021 and 2022, primarily\n\ndue to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion in 2021 and 2022 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional\n\ninformation. Our long-term lease liabilities were $67.7 billion and $73.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Our long-term debt was $48.7 billion and $67.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $14.6 billion and $(16.8) billion during 2021 and 2022. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in\n\nindefinitely.

Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $14.6 billion and $(16.8) billion during 2021 and 2022. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in\n\nother income (expense), net in 2021 and 2022 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $11.8 billion and $(12.7) billion from our equity investment in Rivian. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency\n\ngains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other\n\nfinance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2021 and 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $\n\n46,327 $ 46,752 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (55,396) (58,321) Free cash flow (9,069) (11,569) Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (4,422) (299) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (687) (670) Principal repayments of financing obligations (162) (248) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ (14,340) $ (12,786) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (58,154) $ (37,601) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 6,291 $ 9,718 ___________________ (1) For the year ended December\n\n31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications” of $7,061 million and $675 million. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $11,163 million and $7,941 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate\n\nthe portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as\n\nthe change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. (2) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. 29 Table of Contents Guidance We provided guidance on February 2, 2023, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward- looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our\n\nresults are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” First Quarter 2023 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $121.0 billion and $126.0 billion,\n\nor to grow between 4% and 8% compared with first quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 30\n\nItem 7A.

General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the\n\nquoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards\n\nare remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and, for 2020, a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor partially offset by a lease impairment and, for 2022, $1.1 billion of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases.

Our investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior\n\nto Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 17% ownership interest, and an approximate 16% voting interest.
