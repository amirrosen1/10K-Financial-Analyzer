    "combined_text": "significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for\n\nsale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, current\n\ndebt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, self-insurance liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.4 billion and $7.7 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. Self-Insurance Liabilities Although we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses,\n\nwe effectively self- insure for exposure primarily related to workers’ compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability, and automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our total self-insurance liabilities were $2.2 billion and $4.0 billion and\n\nare included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS\n\nthe 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, April 2022, and December 2022 Notes were 12.6, 14.2, 16.7, 13.3, 13.3, and 5.9 years as of December 31, 2022. The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 13.1 years as of December 31, 2022. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $53.3 billion and $61.4 billion as of December 31,\n\n2021 and 2022, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we increased from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in August 2022 and we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were\n\n$803 million and $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which had an interest rate of 1.5% and 5.6%, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we have pledged $918 million and $1.2 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2022, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as\n\nfollows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2023 $ 3,000 2024 8,500 2025 5,249 2026 3,543 2027 8,750 Thereafter 41,500 $ 70,542 We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In March 2022, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $10.0 billion to $20.0 billion. There\n\nwere $725 million and $6.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which were 56 Table of Contents included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.08% and 4.47%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), which was amended and restated in March 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity from $7.0\n\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $6.9 billion of unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2022. In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan”), which matures in January 2024 and bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan’s maturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase from 0.75%\n\nto 1.05%. As of the date of this filing, the entire Term Loan is outstanding. 57 Table of Contents Note 7 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments, excluding open orders for purchases that support normal operations and are generally cancellable, as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Long-term debt principal and interest $ 5,165 $ 10,618 $ 7,146 $ 5,253 $10,399 $ 63,815 $102,396 Operating lease liabilities 9,574 8,658 8,024 7,393 6,675 40,949 81,273 Finance lease liabilities, including interest 4,575 2,248 1,422 1,279\n\n1,088 7,407 18,019 Financing obligations, including interest (1) 465 464 456 464 471 6,712 9,032 Leases not yet commenced 1,252 2,043 2,185 2,160 2,152 17,237 27,029 Unconditional purchase obligations (2) 8,156 7,217 5,366 4,525 3,419 6,093 34,776 Other commitments (3)(4) 3,173 1,608 1,027 982 622 8,652 16,064 Total commitments $ 32,360 $ 32,856 $ 25,626 $ 22,056 $24,826 $150,865 $288,589 ___________________ (1) Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment, sortation, and data center facilities.

(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of\n\nthe reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. (4) Excludes approximately $4.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any."
