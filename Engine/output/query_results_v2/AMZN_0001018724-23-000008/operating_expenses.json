    "combined_text": "infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in\n\nrates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and\n\nintend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative General and administrative costs were $11.9 billion and $11.8 billion during 2022 and 2023, and were primarily related to payroll and related expenses and professional fees. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $1.3 billion and $767 million during 2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023, and the amortization of intangible assets. 27 Table of Contents Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $989 million and\n\n$2.9 billion during 2022 and 2023, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $2.4 billion and $3.2 billion in 2022 and 2023 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases\n\nand Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Our long-term lease liabilities were $73.0 billion and $77.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our long-term debt was $67.1 billion and $58.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $(16.8) billion and $938 million during 2022 and 2023. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity\n\nproduct categories and services. The North America operating income in 2023, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs. The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by $246 million in\n\n2023. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $220 million in 2023. 25 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2023 Operating Expenses: Cost of sales $ 288,831 $ 304,739 Fulfillment 84,299 90,619 Technology and infrastructure\n\n73,213 85,622 Sales and marketing 42,238 44,370 General and administrative 11,891 11,816 Other operating expense (income), net 1,263 767 Total operating expenses $ 501,735 $ 537,933 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline): Cost of sales 6 % 6 % Fulfillment 12 7 Technology and infrastructure 31 17 Sales and marketing 30 5 General and administrative 35 (1) Other operating expense (income), net 1,936 (39) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 56.2 % 53.0 % Fulfillment 16.4 15.8 Technology and infrastructure 14.2 14.9 Sales and marketing 8.2 7.7 General and administrative 2.3 2.1 Other operating expense (income), net 0.2 0.1 Cost of\n\nSales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies and lower transportation rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $254 million in\n\n2023. Shipping costs were $83.5 billion and $89.5 billion in 2022 and 2023. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our\n\ninventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment.\n\nIncreases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer- term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\n\nbelow for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and\n\noptimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and\n\nsellers become due. Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they\n\nItem 7A.

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of\n\nstock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, the adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an\n\naccelerated method than under a straight-line method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level. Additionally, stock- based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration.\n\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets, and asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023.

(“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2023, we held\n\n158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16% ownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of\n\nmerits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on\n\nthe Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the appropriateness of the Company’s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize.
