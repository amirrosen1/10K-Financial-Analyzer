    "combined_text": "We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Infrastructure Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs\n\ninclude servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience\n\nand improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on\n\ninfrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in\n\nrates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and\n\noptimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and\n\nsellers become due. Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they\n\nare affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix 20 Table of Contents of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our\n\nsystems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in\n\ntechnology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests.\n\nactivities 9,718 (15,879) Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $70.0 billion and $86.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $18.3 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $46.8 billion and $84.9 billion in 2022 and 2023. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from\n\nour consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2023, compared to the prior year, was due to an increase in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion,\n\nthe timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for 22 Table of Contents acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(37.6) billion and $(49.8) billion in 2022 and 2023, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash\n\ncapital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $58.3 billion, and $48.1 billion in 2022 and 2023, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network, which investments we expect to increase in 2024. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $8.3 billion and $5.8 billion in 2022 and 2023. We funded the acquisitions of MGM Holdings Inc. in 2022 and 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In 2023, we invested\n\n$1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible into equity. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $9.7 billion and $(15.9) billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $62.7 billion and $18.1 billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock in 2022, payments of short- term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance\n\nItem 7A.

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of\n\npayments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

The note is classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” The note is classified as a Level 3 asset. We have an\n\nagreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired.\n\nOur assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $715 million and $754 million. Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or\n\nlosses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other\n\nincome (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For\n\ntwelve months, and has a remaining weighted-average recognition period of 0.9 years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023 was 26.5%, 26.5%, and 26.1%. During 2021, 2022, and 2023, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $18.2 billion, $12.8 billion, and $17.6 billion. Common Stock Available for Future Issuance As of December 31, 2023, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 1.6 billion shares. Note 9 — INCOME TAXES In 2021, 2022, and 2023, we recorded a net tax provision (benefit) of $4.8 billion, $(3.2) billion, and $7.1 billion. Our\n\nU.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $3.7 billion, $6.0 billion, and $11.2 billion for 2021, 2022, and 2023. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually\n\nfrom 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated depreciation deduction election for 2021, and a full election for 2022 and 2023. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes. 64 Table of Contents The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes, net are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 U.S. Federal: Current $ 2,129 $ 2,175 $ 8,652 Deferred 155 (6,686) (5,505) Total 2,284 (4,511) 3,147 U.S. State: Current 763 1,074 2,158 Deferred (178) (1,302) (498) Total 585 (228)\n\n1,660 International: Current 2,209 1,682 2,186 Deferred (287) (160) 127 Total 1,922 1,522 2,313 Provision (benefit) for income taxes, net $ 4,791 $ (3,217) $ 7,120 U.S. and international components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 U.S. $ 35,879 $ (8,225) $ 32,328 International 2,272 2,289 5,229 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 38,151 $ (5,936) $ 37,557 The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision (benefit) recorded for income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December\n\n31, 2021 2022 2023 Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate $ 8,012 $ (1,246) $ 7,887 Effect of: Tax impact of foreign earnings and losses (1,349) (370) 594 State taxes, net of federal benefits 465 (173) 1,307 Tax credits (1,136) (1,006) (2,362) Stock-based compensation (1) (1,094) 612 1,047 Foreign income deduction (2) (301) (1,258) (1,429) Other, net 194 224 76 Total $ 4,791 $ (3,217) $ 7,120 ___________________ (1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits or shortfalls from stock-based compensation.
