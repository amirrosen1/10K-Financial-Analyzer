We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in\n\ntechnology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests.\n\nWe utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.6 billion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our\n\ninternational locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can\n\nresult in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December\n\nare affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix 20 Table of Contents of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our\n\nsystems and operations.

In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can\n\nacquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\n\ntheir valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or\n\nperiods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.

Amounts held in foreign currencies were $18.3 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $46.8 billion and $84.9 billion in 2022 and 2023. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from\n\nour consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2023, compared to the prior year, was due to an increase in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion,\n\nItem 7A.

For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of\n\npayments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.

The note is classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” The note is classified as a Level 3 asset. We have an\n\nagreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired.\n\nOur assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $715 million and $754 million. Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or\n\nlosses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other\n\nincome (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For\n\ntotal capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $16.7 billion and $17.4 billion.

Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Such investments are included in\n\n“Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Convertible notes classified as available for sale, equity investments\n\nin private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence and accounted for at cost, and equity investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. 49 Table of Contents In Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. The note is classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” The note is classified as a Level 3 asset. We have an\n\nagreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired.\n\nOur assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $715 million and $754 million. Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or\n\nproceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. 62 Table of Contents The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess\n\nof any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in\n\nexcess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
