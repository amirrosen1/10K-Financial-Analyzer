NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using\n\nthe treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 72,361 $ 72,738 $ 61,271 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,446 7,496 7,547 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 26 44 61 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,472 7,540 7,608 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 9.72 $ 9.70 $ 8.12 Diluted (A/C) $ 9.68 $ 9.65 $ 8.05 Anti-dilutive\n\nstock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented. 70 PART II Item 8 NOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Interest and dividends income $ 2,994 $ 2,094 $ 2,131 Interest expense (1,968) (2,063) (2,346) Net recognized gains on investments 260 461 1,232 Net gains (losses) on derivatives (456) (52) 17 Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements 181 (75) 54 Other, net (223) (32) 98 Total $ 788 $ 333 $ 1,186 Net\n\nRecognized Gains (Losses) on Investments Net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Realized gains from sales of available-for-sale securities $ 36 $ 162 $ 105 Realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (124) (138) (40) Impairments and allowance for credit losses (10) (81) (2) Total $ (98) $ (57) $ 63 Net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net realized gains on investments sold $ 75 $ 29 $ 123 Net unrealized gains on investments still\n\nheld 303 509 1,057 Impairments of investments (20) (20) (11) Total $ 358 $ 518 $ 1,169 71 PART II Item 8 NOTE 4 — INVESTMENTS Investment Components The components of investments were as follows: Cash Short- Fair Adjusted Unrealiz Unrealiz Recorde and Cash term Equity Value Cost ed ed d Equivalen Investmen Investmen (In millions) Level Basis Gains Losses Basis ts ts ts June 30, 2023 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial 16,58 16,58 paper Level 2 $ 9 $ 0 $ 0 $ 9 $ 12,231 $ 4,358 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level\n\nbased on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the\n\nlease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line\n\nmethod over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.
