We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using\n\nthe treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 72,361 $ 72,738 $ 61,271 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,446 7,496 7,547 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 26 44 61 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,472 7,540 7,608 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 9.72 $ 9.70 $ 8.12 Diluted (A/C) $ 9.68 $ 9.65 $ 8.05 Anti-dilutive\n\nstock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented. 70 PART II Item 8 NOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Interest and dividends income $ 2,994 $ 2,094 $ 2,131 Interest expense (1,968) (2,063) (2,346) Net recognized gains on investments 260 461 1,232 Net gains (losses) on derivatives (456) (52) 17 Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements 181 (75) 54 Other, net (223) (32) 98 Total $ 788 $ 333 $ 1,186 Net\n\nRecognized Gains (Losses) on Investments Net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Realized gains from sales of available-for-sale securities $ 36 $ 162 $ 105 Realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (124) (138) (40) Impairments and allowance for credit losses (10) (81) (2) Total $ (98) $ (57) $ 63 Net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net realized gains on investments sold $ 75 $ 29 $ 123 Net unrealized gains on investments still\n\nheld 303 509 1,057 Impairments of investments (20) (20) (11) Total $ 358 $ 518 $ 1,169 71 PART II Item 8 NOTE 4 — INVESTMENTS Investment Components The components of investments were as follows: Cash Short- Fair Adjusted Unrealiz Unrealiz Recorde and Cash term Equity Value Cost ed ed d Equivalen Investmen Investmen (In millions) Level Basis Gains Losses Basis ts ts ts June 30, 2023 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial 16,58 16,58 paper Level 2 $ 9 $ 0 $ 0 $ 9 $ 12,231 $ 4,358 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level\n\nand cash equivalents, end of period $ 34,704 $ 13,931 $ 14,224 Refer to accompanying notes. 61 PART II Item 8 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY STATEMENTS (In millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Common stock and paid-in capital Balance, beginning of period $ 86,939 $ 83,111 $ 80,552 Common stock issued 1,866 1,841 1,963 Common stock repurchased (4,696) (5,688) (5,539) Stock-based compensation expense 9,611 7,502 6,118 Other, net (2) 173 17 Balance, end of period 93,718 86,939 83,111 Retained earnings Balance, beginning of period 84,281 57,055 34,566 Net income 72,361 72,738 61,271 Common stock cash dividends\n\n(20,226) (18,552) (16,871) Common stock repurchased (17,568) (26,960) (21,879) Cumulative effect of accounting changes 0 0 (32) Balance, end of period 118,848 84,281 57,055 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) Balance, beginning of period (4,678) 1,822 3,186 Other comprehensive loss (1,665) (6,500) (1,374) Cumulative effect of accounting changes 0 0 10 Balance, end of period (6,343) (4,678) 1,822 Total stockholders’ equity $ 206,223 $ 166,542 $ 141,988 Cash dividends declared per common share $ 2.72 $ 2.48 $ 2.24 Refer to accompanying notes. 62 PART II Item 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles Our consolidated\n\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\n\nassets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our\n\nproducts; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network\n\nseparately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for\n\nindividual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products\n\nand services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at\n\nthe beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows\n\npost-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component."
