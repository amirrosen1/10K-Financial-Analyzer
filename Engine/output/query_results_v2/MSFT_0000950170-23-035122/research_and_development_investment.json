Capitalized software development costs are amortized\n\nover the estimated lives of the products. 66 PART II Item 8 Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days\n\nto three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development\n\nexpense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal\n\nyears 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is\n\nFair Adjusted Unrealiz Unrealiz Recorde and Cash term Equity Value Cost ed ed d Equivalen Investmen Investmen (In millions) Level Basis Gains Losses Basis ts ts ts June 30, 2022 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 2,500 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,500 $ 2,498 $ 2 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,071 0 0 2,071 2,032 39 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 79,696 29 (2,178) 77,547 9 77,538 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 419 0 (9) 410 0 410 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 506 0\n\n(24) 482 0 482 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Level 2 727 1 (30) 698 0 698 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 11,661 4 (554) 11,111 0 11,111 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 67 0 0 67 0 67 0 Municipal securities Level 2 368 19 (13) 374 0 374 0 Municipal securities Level 3 103 0 (6) 97 0 97 0 Total debt investments $98,118 $ 53 $ (2,814) $95,357 $ 4,539 $ 90,818 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Equity investments Level 1 $ 1,590 $ 1,134 $ 0 $\n\n456 Equity investments Other 6,435 0 0 6,435 Total equity investments $ 8,025 $ 1,134 $ 0 $ 6,891 Cash $ 8,258 $ 8,258 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) 8 0 8 0 Total 111,64 $ 8 $ 13,931 $ 90,826 $ 6,891 (a) Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments.

These provisions require us to capitalize research and development expenditures and amortize them on our U.S. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research\n\nis conducted. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2023, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $509 million, $1.2 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates ranging from fiscal year 2024 to 2043 or indefinite carryforward periods, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating\n\nloss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2023, we had $456 million federal capital loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes from our acquisition of Nuance. The federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and will expire in fiscal year 2025. 84 PART II Item 8 The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other"
