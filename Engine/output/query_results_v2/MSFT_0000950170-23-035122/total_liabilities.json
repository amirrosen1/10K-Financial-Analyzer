We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 65 PART II Item 8 Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 710 $ 798 $ 816 Charged to costs and other 258 157 234 Write-offs (252) (245) (252) Balance, end of period $ 716 $ 710 $ 798 Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\n\n(In millions) June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 650 $ 633 $ 751 Other long-term assets 66 77 47 Total $ 716 $ 710 $ 798 As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were $9.2 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited\n\nnumber of countries. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, our financing receivables, net were $5.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than\n\none year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.\n\nCost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud- based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized\n\nAAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. 75 PART II Item 8 The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar equivalents: June 30, June 30, (In millions) 2023 2022 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased $ 1,492 $ 635 Interest rate contracts purchased 1,078 1,139 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased 7,874 10,322 Foreign exchange contracts sold 25,159 21,606 Equity contracts purchased 3,867 1,131 Equity contracts sold 2,154 0 Other contracts purchased 1,224 1,642\n\nOther contracts sold 581 544 Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following table presents our derivative instruments: (In millions) Derivative Derivative Derivative Derivative Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities June 30, June 30, 2023 2022 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts $ 34 $ (67) $ 0 $ (77) Interest rate contracts 16 0 3 0 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts 249 (332) 333 (362) Equity contracts 165 (400) 5 (95) Other contracts 5 (6) 15 (17) Gross amounts of derivatives 469 (805) 356 (551) Gross amounts of derivatives offset in the balance (202) 206 (130) 133 sheet\n\nCash collateral received 0 (125) 0 (75) Net amounts of derivatives $ 267 $ (724) $ 226 $ (493) Reported as Short-term investments $ 6 $ 0 $ 8 $ 0 Other current assets 245 0 218 0 Other long-term assets 16 0 0 0 Other current liabilities 0 (341) 0 (298) Other long-term liabilities 0 (383) 0 (195) Total $ 267 $ (724) $ 226 $ (493) Gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $442 million and $804 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2023, and\n\n$343 million and $550 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2022.

The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying. Irish Data Protection Commission Matter In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint\n\nagainst LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision. Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that\n\nresolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $617 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period\n\nin which the effects become reasonably estimable. 88 PART II Item 8 NOTE 16 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of year 7,464 7,519 7,571 Issued 37 40 49 Repurchased (69) (95) (101) Balance, end of year 7,432 7,464 7,519 Share Repurchases On September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.
