    "combined_text": "Live transactions, and the Windows Phone Store; search advertising; display advertising; Office 365 Consumer, comprising Office 365 Home and Office 365 Personal; Studios, comprising first-party video games; and our retail stores. Windows Store and Windows Phone Store are online application marketplaces that are designed to benefit our developers and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base and benefit users by providing centralized access to certified applications. Xbox Live transactions consist of online entertainment content, such as games, music, movies, and TV shows, accessible on Xbox consoles and other devices. Search and display advertising includes Bing, Bing Ads,\n\nMSN, Windows Services, and Xbox ads. We are the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! websites worldwide. We have completed the Yahoo! worldwide algorithmic transition and the paid search transition in the U.S. and planned international markets. Office 365 Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of Microsoft Office programs and services delivered across multiple platforms via the cloud. Studios designs and markets games for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and online. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users and increase engagement by developing a deep library of content which consumers seek. Competition We\n\nface competition for our Resale products and services from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, and Google. Our search and display advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals like Yahoo! that provide content and online offerings to end users. Our success depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. We believe we can attract new users by continuing to offer new and compelling products and services. We differentiate our offerings by providing a broad selection of\n\ncontent that helps users make faster, informed decisions, and take action more quickly by providing relevant search results, expanded search services, and deeply-integrated social recommendations. Competitors to Office 365 Consumer are the same as those discussed above for Office Consumer. 6 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 Competitors to Studios are the same as those discussed above for our Xbox gaming and entertainment business, as well as game studios like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Commercial Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and organization productivity and efficiency, and to simplify\n\neveryday tasks through seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software. Commercial is made up of the Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other segments. Commercial Licensing The principal products and services provided by the Commercial Licensing segment are: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CAL”); Windows Embedded; volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic (“Windows Commercial”); Microsoft Office for business, including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CAL (“Office Commercial”); Skype; and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online. Our server products are designed to make information\n\nwith other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. In conjunction with the NDS acquisition, we received an initial 10-year non-exclusive license to certain Nokia patents. We also agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and granted Nokia reciprocal rights to use our patents for their mapping and location services. While it may\n\nbe necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Investing in the Future Microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to\n\nenter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and 10 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. We maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning communication and collaboration, information access and organization, entertainment, business and e-commerce, advertising, and devices. While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate\n\nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated\n\nwith other segments and leveraged across the company. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our product and service innovation. Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth in productivity, platforms, cloud computing, search,\n\nthe mobile-first and cloud-first world. We will continue to create new opportunities for partners, increase customer satisfaction, and improve our service excellence, business efficacy, and internal processes. OPERATING SEGMENTS During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments: Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Licensing, D&C Hardware, D&C Other, Commercial\n\nLicensing, and Commercial Other. 3 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 On April 25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services Business (“NDS”). We report the financial performance of NDS in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C Hardware segment was renamed Computing\n\nand Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements. Devices and Consumer Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products\n\nand services designed to increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, entertain and connect people, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our D&C segments are made up of D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other. D&C Licensing The principal products and services provided by the D&C Licensing segment are: Windows, including original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”); Windows\n\nPhone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue. The Windows operating system is designed to empower individuals, companies, and organizations to simplify everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software. Windows revenue growth is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted by: • the mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size; • differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets;\n\ncompetitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in our businesses are low and software products can 15 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in\n\nmaking innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. The strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the Windows 8 operating system, Surface, Windows Phone, Xbox One, and associated cloud-based\n\nservices. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and digital music players. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services; however, our competitors in smartphones and tablets have established significantly larger user bases. Competing with the vertically integrated model\n\nwill increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. • We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices\n\nmay make it more difficult to attract application developers to our platforms. Competing operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease PC operating system margins. In addition, Surface competes with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. • The success of the Windows phone platform is an important element of our goal to enhance personal productivity in a mobile-first and cloud-first world. The marketplace among mobile phone platforms is highly competitive. We may face issues in selecting, engaging or securing support from operators and retailers for Windows phones due to, for\n\nethics, global corporate citizenship initiatives, and other governance- related policies; • other news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting; and • opportunities to sign up for email alerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed\n\nto be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our\n\ncompetitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in our businesses are low and software products can 15 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in\n\nmaking innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. The strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the Windows 8 operating system, Surface, Windows Phone, Xbox One, and associated cloud-based\n\nservices. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and digital music players. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services; however, our competitors in smartphones and tablets have established significantly larger user bases. Competing with the vertically integrated model\n\nand • making our suite of cloud-based services platform agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenues in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. We make significant investments in new\n\nproducts and services that may not be profitable. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support,\n\nand effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and 17 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. Developing\n\nnew technologies is complex and time-consuming. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we get no satisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new\n\nemployees, business systems, and technology, or that the transaction distracts management from our other businesses. The success of these transactions will depend in part on our ability to leverage them enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In April 2014, we acquired from Nokia substantially all of its NDS business to\n\nand approximately five million square feet of space we lease. We own approximately three million additional square feet of office and data center space domestically (outside of the Puget Sound corporate campus) and lease many sites domestically totaling approximately five million square feet of office and data center space. We occupy many sites internationally, totaling approximately five million square feet that is owned and approximately twelve million square feet that is leased.
