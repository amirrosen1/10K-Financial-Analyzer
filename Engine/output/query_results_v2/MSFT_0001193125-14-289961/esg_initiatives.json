Investing in the Future Microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to\n\nenter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and 10 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. We maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning communication and collaboration, information access and organization, entertainment, business and e-commerce, advertising, and devices. While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate\n\nresearch and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated\n\nwith other segments and leveraged across the company. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our product and service innovation. Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth in productivity, platforms, cloud computing, search,\n\ncommunications, and smart connected devices. DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services primarily through the following channels: OEMs; distributors and resellers; online; and Microsoft retail stores. OEMs We distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new PCs, tablets, servers, smartphones, and other intelligent devices that they sell to end customers. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and applications such as our Microsoft Office suite. In addition to these\n\nwith other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. In conjunction with the NDS acquisition, we received an initial 10-year non-exclusive license to certain Nokia patents. We also agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and granted Nokia reciprocal rights to use our patents for their mapping and location services.

Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development, we see significant opportunities to drive future growth in productivity, platforms, cloud computing, search,\n\nDuring fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, research and development expense was $11.4 billion, $10.4 billion, and $9.8 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 13% of revenue in each of those years. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. Product and Service Development and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through four primary engineering groups. • Applications and Services Engineering Group, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, search, and other information categories. • Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group, focuses on development\n\nof Microsoft’s back-end technologies like datacenter, database, and our specific technologies for enterprise IT scenarios and development tools. This group also engineers datacenter development, construction, and operation. • Devices Engineering Group, focuses on all hardware development and supply chain, including Xbox consoles, Surface devices, Lumia Smartphones, other non-Lumia phones, Perceptive Pixel products, and accessories. • Operating Systems Engineering Group, focuses on Microsoft’s operating systems for consoles, mobile devices, PCs, and back-end systems. Studios and Universal Store, the core cloud services for marketplaces, membership, and commerce platform, are also in this group. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that\n\ncome from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S.\n\nand internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 55,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 40,000 pending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or Microsoft’s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements\n\nwith other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our\n\ncompetitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in our businesses are low and software products can 15 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.
