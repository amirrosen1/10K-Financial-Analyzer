Our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and are generated from our regional operating centers, were 81%, 79%, and\n\n79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, adjustments for intercompany transfer pricing, U.S. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. In fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2014 2013 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 903 $ 888 Other expense items 1,112 917 Unearned revenue 520 445 Impaired investments 209 246 Loss carryforwards 922 715 Other\n\nrevenue items 64 55 Deferred income tax assets $ 3,730 $ 3,266 Less valuation allowance (903) (579) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 2,827 $ 2,687 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Foreign earnings $ (1,140) $ (1,146) Unrealized gain on investments (1,911) (1,012) Depreciation and amortization (470) (604) Other (87) (2) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (3,608) $ (2,764) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ (781) $ (77) Reported As Current deferred income tax assets $ 1,941 $ 1,632 Other current liabilities (125) 0 Other long-term assets 131 0 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (2,728) (1,709) Net\n\nimpairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates\n\nand assumptions. Recasting of Certain Prior Period Information During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial performance based on our new segments described in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during fiscal\n\nyear 2014. This change impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 14 – Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and\n\ncollectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 58 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to\n\nthe respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management\n\nof fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax\n\ncontingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2013. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013,\n\nsome of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, and certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases was $874 million, $711 million, and $639 million, in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of June 30, 2014\n\nare as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2015 $ 878 2016 748 2017 671 2018 598 2019 456 Thereafter 1,063 Total $ 4,414 Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs"
