Revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud- based offerings. 30 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface\n\ndevices sold, and $575 million higher datacenter expenses, primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were: • Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, due mainly to increased investment in new products and services in our Devices engineering group, including NDS expenses, and increased investment in our Applications and Services engineering group. • Sales and marketing\n\nexpenses increased $535 million or 4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased investment in sales resources, offset in part by lower advertising costs.

Revenue was also impacted by the timing of revenue deferrals. Operating income grew $5.0 billion or 23%, primarily due to the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year. Other key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were: • Cost of revenue increased $2.7 billion or 16%, reflecting\n\nincreased product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8, including an approximately $900 million charge for Surface RT inventory adjustments, higher headcount-related expenses, payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, royalties on Xbox Live content, and retail stores expenses, offset in part by decreased costs associated with lower sales of Xbox 360 consoles and decreased traffic acquisition costs. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion or 10%, reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface. • Research and development expenses increased $600 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, largely related to the Xbox Platform. •\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $580 million or 13%, due to higher legal charges, primarily due to the European Commission fine of €561 million (approximately $733 million) for failure to comply with our 2009 agreement to display a “Browser Choice Screen” on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer is the default browser (the “EU fine”). 31 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Devices and Consumer Percentage Percentage Change 2014 Change 2013 (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2013 2012 Versus 2013 Versus 2012 Revenue Licensing $ 18,803 $ 19,021 $ 19,495 (1)% (2)% Hardware: Computing and Gaming\n\nHardware 9,628 6,461 6,740 49% (4)% Phone Hardware 1,985 0 0 * * Total D&C Hardware 11,613 6,461 6,740 80% (4)% Other 7,258 6,618 6,203 10% 7% Total D&C revenue $ 37,674 $ 32,100 $ 32,438 17% (1)% Gross Margin Licensing $ 17,216 $ 17,044 $ 17,240 1% (1)% Hardware: Computing and Gaming Hardware 893 956 2,495 (7)% (62)% Phone Hardware 54 0 0 * * Total D&C Hardware 947 956 2,495 (1)% (62)% Other 1,770 2,046 1,998 (13)% 2% Total D&C gross margin $ 19,933 $ 20,046 $ 21,733 (1)% (8)% * Not meaningful Fiscal year 2014 compared with\n\nfiscal year 2013 D&C revenue increased $5.6 billion or 17%, primarily due to higher revenue from Xbox Platform, Surface, and Windows Phone.

Cost of revenue increased $5.7 billion or 47%, due mainly to Xbox Platform and Surface. Cost of revenue also increased $1.9 billion due to NDS. D&C Licensing D&C Licensing revenue decreased $218 million or 1%, due mainly to lower revenue from licenses of Windows and Office Consumer, as well as a\n\ndecrease in royalty revenue, offset in part by increased Windows Phone revenue. Retail and non- OEM sales of Windows declined $304 million or 41%, due mainly to the launch of Windows 8 in the prior year. Windows OEM revenue declined $136 million or 1%, due to continued softness in the consumer PC market, offset in part by a 12% increase in OEM Pro revenue. Office Consumer revenue declined $243 million or 8%, reflecting the transition of customers to Office 365 Consumer as well as continued softness in the consumer PC market.

The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio\n\nreturns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. VALUE-AT-RISK We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary\n\nlosses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several\n\nrisk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. 51\n\nItem 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are\n\nexposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar.

(In millions) Year\n\nEnded June 30, 2014 2013 2012\n\nallocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology. We do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, Devices and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises or in the cloud. Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows: • Sales\n\nand marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment. • Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group. 92 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 • General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin.

(In millions) Year\n\nEnded June 30, 2014 2013 2012\n\nof fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax\n\ncontingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2013. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013,\n\nsome of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs"
