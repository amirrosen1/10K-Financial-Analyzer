BUSINESS GENERAL Microsoft was founded in 1975. Our mission is to enable people and organizations throughout the world to do more and achieve more by creating technology that transforms the way people learn, work, play, and communicate. We develop and market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives. We do business worldwide and have offices in more than 100 countries. We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products and services, by designing, manufacturing, and\n\nDuring fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, research and development expense was $11.4 billion, $10.4 billion, and $9.8 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 13% of revenue in each of those years. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. Product and Service Development and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through four primary engineering groups. • Applications and Services Engineering Group, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, search, and other information categories. • Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group, focuses on development\n\nof Microsoft’s back-end technologies like datacenter, database, and our specific technologies for enterprise IT scenarios and development tools. This group also engineers datacenter development, construction, and operation. • Devices Engineering Group, focuses on all hardware development and supply chain, including Xbox consoles, Surface devices, Lumia Smartphones, other non-Lumia phones, Perceptive Pixel products, and accessories. • Operating Systems Engineering Group, focuses on Microsoft’s operating systems for consoles, mobile devices, PCs, and back-end systems. Studios and Universal Store, the core cloud services for marketplaces, membership, and commerce platform, are also in this group. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that\n\ncome from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S.\n\nand internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 55,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 40,000 pending. While we employ much of our internally developed intellectual property exclusively in Microsoft products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ or Microsoft’s products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements\n\nwith other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. In conjunction with the NDS acquisition, we received an initial 10-year non-exclusive license to certain Nokia patents. We also agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and granted Nokia reciprocal rights to use our patents for their mapping and location services. While it may\n\nenacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems. Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, Lumia Smartphones, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We get some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and\n\ntheir demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole- source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles and Surface devices and Lumia phones are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\n\nThese same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. 22 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A Our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or\n\nlimit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. We operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion\n\nof our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries. Catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion\n\nand any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with or furnish it to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”); • information on our business strategies, financial results, and key performance indicators; • announcements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and competitive strategies. Archives of these events are also available; • press releases on quarterly earnings, product and service announcements, legal developments, and international news; • corporate governance information including our articles of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, committee charters, codes of conduct and\n\nethics, global corporate citizenship initiatives, and other governance- related policies; • other news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting; and • opportunities to sign up for email alerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed\n\nto be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our\n\ncompetitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in our businesses are low and software products can 15 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low cost. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in\n\nmaking innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. The strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the Windows 8 operating system, Surface, Windows Phone, Xbox One, and associated cloud-based\n\ntheir demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us.

Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion\n\nof our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact\n\nour facilities in Salo, Finland and Reading, UK.
