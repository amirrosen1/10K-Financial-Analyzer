    "combined_text": "of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an I.R.S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the I.R.S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February 2012, the I.R.S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax\n\ncontingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the I.R.S. for tax years 2007 to 2013. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2013,\n\nsome of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 14 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows, with segments with significant balances shown separately: (In millions) June 30, 2014 2013 Commercial Licensing $ 19,099 $ 18,460 Commercial Other 3,934 2,272 Rest of the segments 2,125 1,667 Total $ 25,158 $ 22,399 82 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 NOTE 15 — OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES (In millions) June 30, 2014 2013 Tax contingencies and other tax liabilities $\n\n10,510 $ 9,548 Other 1,084 452 Total $ 11,594 $ 10,000 NOTE 16 — COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES Construction and Operating Leases We have committed $880 million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of June 30, 2014. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, and certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases was $874 million, $711 million, and $639 million, in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of June 30, 2014\n\nare as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2015 $ 878 2016 748 2017 671 2018 598 2019 456 Thereafter 1,063 Total $ 4,414 Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs\n\nAcquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed become available. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows: (In millions) Cash $ 1,503 Accounts receivable (a) 754 Inventories 544 Other current assets 960 Property and equipment 981 Intangible assets 4,509 Goodwill (b) 5,458 Other 249 Current liabilities (4,576) Long-term liabilities (917) Total purchase price $ 9,465 (a) Gross accounts receivable is $901 million, of which $147\n\nmillion is expected to be uncollectible. (b) Goodwill was assigned to our new Phone Hardware segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of NDS. Goodwill of $4.5 billion is expected to be deductible in Finland for tax purposes. Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: Weighted (In millions) Amount Average Life Technology-based $ 2,493 9 years Contract-based 1,500 9 years Customer-related 359 3 years Marketing-related (trade names) 157 2 years Fair value of intangible assets acquired $ 4,509 8 years Our consolidated\n\nincome statement for fiscal year 2014 includes revenue and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively, attributable to NDS since the Acquisition. 74 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Following are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been consummated on July 1, 2012: (In millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 Revenue $ 96,248 $ 93,243 Net income $ 20,234 $ 20,153 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.41 $ 2.38 These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which\n\nwe believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other non-recurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period presented. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs are primarily\n\ncomprised of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are included in Integration and restructuring costs on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014. Certain concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition, we agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for the\n\n101,466 Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $14,793 and $12,513 13,011 9,991 Equity and other investments 14,597 10,844 Goodwill 20,127 14,655 Intangible assets, net 6,981 3,083 Other long-term assets 3,422 2,392 Total assets $ 172,384 $ 142,431 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 7,432 $ 4,828 Short-term debt 2,000 0 Current portion of long-term debt 0 2,999 Accrued compensation 4,797 4,117 Income taxes 782 592 Short-term unearned revenue 23,150 20,639 Securities lending payable 558 645 Other 6,906 3,597 Total current liabilities 45,625 37,417 Long-term debt 20,645 12,601 Long-term unearned revenue 2,008 1,760 Deferred income taxes\n\n2,728 1,709 Other long-term liabilities 11,594 10,000 Total liabilities 82,600 63,487 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Common stock and paid-in capital – shares authorized 24,000; outstanding 8,239 and 8,328 68,366 67,306 Retained earnings 17,710 9,895 Accumulated other comprehensive income 3,708 1,743 Total stockholders’ equity 89,784 78,944 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 172,384 $ 142,431 See accompanying notes. 55 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Operations Net income $ 22,074 $ 21,863 $ 16,978 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash from operations: Goodwill impairment 0\n\n0 6,193 Depreciation, amortization, and other 5,212 3,755 2,967 Stock-based compensation expense 2,446 2,406 2,244 Net recognized losses (gains) on investments and derivatives (109) 80 (200) Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation (271) (209) (93) Deferred income taxes (331) (19) 954 Deferral of unearned revenue 44,325 44,253 36,104 Recognition of unearned revenue (41,739) (41,921) (33,347) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (1,120) (1,807) (1,156) Inventories (161) (802) 184 Other current assets (29) (129) 493 Other long-term assets (628) (478) (248) Accounts payable 473 537 (31) Other current liabilities 1,075 146 410 Other long-term liabilities 1,014 1,158 174 Net\n\ncash from operations 32,231 28,833 31,626 Financing Proceeds from issuance of short-term debt, maturities of 90 days or less, net 500 0 0 Proceeds from issuance of debt 10,350 4,883 0 Repayments of debt (3,888) (1,346) 0 Common stock issued 607 931 1,913 Common stock repurchased (7,316) (5,360) (5,029) Common stock cash dividends paid (8,879) (7,455) (6,385) Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation 271 209 93 Other (39) (10) 0 Net cash used in financing (8,394) (8,148) (9,408) Investing Additions to property and equipment (5,485) (4,257) (2,305) Acquisition of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other\n\nassets (5,937) (1,584) (10,112) Purchases of investments (72,690) (75,396) (57,250) Maturities of investments 5,272 5,130 15,575 Sales of investments 60,094 52,464 29,700 Securities lending payable (87) (168) (394) Net cash used in investing (18,833) (23,811) (24,786) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (139) (8) (104) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 4,865 (3,134) (2,672) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 3,804 6,938 9,610 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 8,669 $ 3,804 $ 6,938 See accompanying notes. 56 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June"
