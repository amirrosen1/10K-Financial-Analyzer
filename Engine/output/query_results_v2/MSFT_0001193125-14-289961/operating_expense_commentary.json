    "combined_text": "competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding: • revenue deferred on certain devices bundled with other products and services (“Bundled Offerings”); and • revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the “Windows\n\nUpgrade Offer”). If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction- based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Reportable Segments The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis.\n\nAll differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and other. Operating expenses are not allocated to our segments. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed\n\nand monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. Our reportable segments are described below. On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS for total consideration of $9.5 billion. This amount was greater than the $7.2 billion disclosed previously, primarily due to $1.5 billion of cash acquired, foreign currency movements of $330 million, working capital adjustments of $210 million, and other adjustments of $260 million. See Note 9 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional details. NDS has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. We report the financial\n\nperformance of the acquired business in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. 29 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed\n\nyear 2013 Revenue increased $9.0 billion or 12%, demonstrating growth across our consumer and commercial businesses, primarily due to higher revenue from server products, Xbox Platform, Commercial Cloud, and Surface. Revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud- based offerings. 30 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface\n\ndevices sold, and $575 million higher datacenter expenses, primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were: • Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, due mainly to increased investment in new products and services in our Devices engineering group, including NDS expenses, and increased investment in our Applications and Services engineering group. • Sales and marketing\n\nexpenses increased $535 million or 4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased investment in sales resources, offset in part by lower advertising costs. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Revenue increased $4.1 billion or 6%, mainly due to growth in revenue from our Commercial segments. Revenue was also impacted by the timing of revenue deferrals. Operating income grew $5.0 billion or 23%, primarily due to the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year. Other key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were: • Cost of revenue increased $2.7 billion or 16%, reflecting\n\nincreased product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8, including an approximately $900 million charge for Surface RT inventory adjustments, higher headcount-related expenses, payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, royalties on Xbox Live content, and retail stores expenses, offset in part by decreased costs associated with lower sales of Xbox 360 consoles and decreased traffic acquisition costs. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion or 10%, reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface. • Research and development expenses increased $600 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, largely related to the Xbox Platform. •\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $580 million or 13%, due to higher legal charges, primarily due to the European Commission fine of €561 million (approximately $733 million) for failure to comply with our 2009 agreement to display a “Browser Choice Screen” on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer is the default browser (the “EU fine”). 31 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Devices and Consumer Percentage Percentage Change 2014 Change 2013 (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2013 2012 Versus 2013 Versus 2012 Revenue Licensing $ 18,803 $ 19,021 $ 19,495 (1)% (2)% Hardware: Computing and Gaming\n\nheadcount-related expenses, mainly due to higher Enterprise Services headcount supporting revenue growth.

Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Corporate and Other revenue decreased $818 million, primarily due to the timing of\n\nrevenue deferrals. During fiscal year 2014, we deferred a net $349 million of revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During fiscal year 2013, we recognized $540 million of previously deferred revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. The revenue was recognized upon expiration of the offer. Corporate and Other gross margin decreased $866 million, due mainly to decreased revenue. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Corporate and Other revenue increased $888 million or 183%, primarily due to the timing of revenue deferrals. During fiscal year 2013, we recognized $540 million of revenue that had been deferred in fiscal year\n\n2012 related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. The revenue was recognized upon expiration of the offer. Corporate and Other gross margin increased $954 million or 164%, due mainly to increased revenue.

Hood Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Frank H. Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer 50 Table of Contents PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are\n\nexposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Interest Rate Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily\n\nof investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio\n\nof investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio\n\nreturns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. VALUE-AT-RISK We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary\n\nlosses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several\n\nrisk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. 51\n\n101,466 Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $14,793 and $12,513 13,011 9,991 Equity and other investments 14,597 10,844 Goodwill 20,127 14,655 Intangible assets, net 6,981 3,083 Other long-term assets 3,422 2,392 Total assets $ 172,384 $ 142,431 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 7,432 $ 4,828 Short-term debt 2,000 0 Current portion of long-term debt 0 2,999 Accrued compensation 4,797 4,117 Income taxes 782 592 Short-term unearned revenue 23,150 20,639 Securities lending payable 558 645 Other 6,906 3,597 Total current liabilities 45,625 37,417 Long-term debt 20,645 12,601 Long-term unearned revenue 2,008 1,760 Deferred income taxes\n\n2,728 1,709 Other long-term liabilities 11,594 10,000 Total liabilities 82,600 63,487 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Common stock and paid-in capital – shares authorized 24,000; outstanding 8,239 and 8,328 68,366 67,306 Retained earnings 17,710 9,895 Accumulated other comprehensive income 3,708 1,743 Total stockholders’ equity 89,784 78,944 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 172,384 $ 142,431 See accompanying notes. 55 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Operations Net income $ 22,074 $ 21,863 $ 16,978 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash from operations: Goodwill impairment 0\n\n0 6,193 Depreciation, amortization, and other 5,212 3,755 2,967 Stock-based compensation expense 2,446 2,406 2,244 Net recognized losses (gains) on investments and derivatives (109) 80 (200) Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation (271) (209) (93) Deferred income taxes (331) (19) 954 Deferral of unearned revenue 44,325 44,253 36,104 Recognition of unearned revenue (41,739) (41,921) (33,347) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (1,120) (1,807) (1,156) Inventories (161) (802) 184 Other current assets (29) (129) 493 Other long-term assets (628) (478) (248) Accounts payable 473 537 (31) Other current liabilities 1,075 146 410 Other long-term liabilities 1,014 1,158 174 Net\n\ncash from operations 32,231 28,833 31,626 Financing Proceeds from issuance of short-term debt, maturities of 90 days or less, net 500 0 0 Proceeds from issuance of debt 10,350 4,883 0 Repayments of debt (3,888) (1,346) 0 Common stock issued 607 931 1,913 Common stock repurchased (7,316) (5,360) (5,029) Common stock cash dividends paid (8,879) (7,455) (6,385) Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation 271 209 93 Other (39) (10) 0 Net cash used in financing (8,394) (8,148) (9,408) Investing Additions to property and equipment (5,485) (4,257) (2,305) Acquisition of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other\n\nassets (5,937) (1,584) (10,112) Purchases of investments (72,690) (75,396) (57,250) Maturities of investments 5,272 5,130 15,575 Sales of investments 60,094 52,464 29,700 Securities lending payable (87) (168) (394) Net cash used in investing (18,833) (23,811) (24,786) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (139) (8) (104) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 4,865 (3,134) (2,672) Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 3,804 6,938 9,610 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 8,669 $ 3,804 $ 6,938 See accompanying notes. 56 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June\n\nand marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment. • Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group. 92 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 • General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin.
