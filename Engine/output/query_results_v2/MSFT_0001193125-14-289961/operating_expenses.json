Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. See a discussion of these factors and other risks under Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Unearned Revenue Quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue. See the discussions below regarding: • revenue deferred on certain devices bundled with other products and services (“Bundled Offerings”); and • revenue deferred on sales of Windows 7 with an option to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro at a discounted price (the “Windows\n\nUpgrade Offer”). If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction- based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Reportable Segments The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Segment information appearing in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) is also presented on this basis.\n\nAll differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and other. Operating expenses are not allocated to our segments. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, we have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally managed\n\nand monitored segment performance during fiscal year 2014. Our reportable segments are described below. On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS for total consideration of $9.5 billion. This amount was greater than the $7.2 billion disclosed previously, primarily due to $1.5 billion of cash acquired, foreign currency movements of $330 million, working capital adjustments of $210 million, and other adjustments of $260 million. See Note 9 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements for additional details. NDS has been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on the acquisition date. We report the financial\n\nperformance of the acquired business in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment, the D&C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. 29 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed\n\nyear 2013 Revenue increased $9.0 billion or 12%, demonstrating growth across our consumer and commercial businesses, primarily due to higher revenue from server products, Xbox Platform, Commercial Cloud, and Surface. Revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud- based offerings. 30 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface\n\ndevices sold, and $575 million higher datacenter expenses, primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were: • Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, due mainly to increased investment in new products and services in our Devices engineering group, including NDS expenses, and increased investment in our Applications and Services engineering group. • Sales and marketing\n\nexpenses increased $535 million or 4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased investment in sales resources, offset in part by lower advertising costs. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Revenue increased $4.1 billion or 6%, mainly due to growth in revenue from our Commercial segments. Revenue was also impacted by the timing of revenue deferrals. Operating income grew $5.0 billion or 23%, primarily due to the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded during the prior year. Other key changes in cost of revenue and operating expenses were: • Cost of revenue increased $2.7 billion or 16%, reflecting\n\nincreased product costs associated with Surface and Windows 8, including an approximately $900 million charge for Surface RT inventory adjustments, higher headcount-related expenses, payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, royalties on Xbox Live content, and retail stores expenses, offset in part by decreased costs associated with lower sales of Xbox 360 consoles and decreased traffic acquisition costs. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion or 10%, reflecting advertising of Windows 8 and Surface. • Research and development expenses increased $600 million or 6%, due mainly to higher headcount-related expenses, largely related to the Xbox Platform. •\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $580 million or 13%, due to higher legal charges, primarily due to the European Commission fine of €561 million (approximately $733 million) for failure to comply with our 2009 agreement to display a “Browser Choice Screen” on Windows PCs where Internet Explorer is the default browser (the “EU fine”). 31 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Devices and Consumer Percentage Percentage Change 2014 Change 2013 (In millions, except percentages) 2014 2013 2012 Versus 2013 Versus 2012 Revenue Licensing $ 18,803 $ 19,021 $ 19,495 (1)% (2)% Hardware: Computing and Gaming\n\nheadcount-related expenses, mainly due to higher Enterprise Services headcount supporting revenue growth.

Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Corporate and Other revenue decreased $818 million, primarily due to the timing of\n\nrevenue deferrals. During fiscal year 2014, we deferred a net $349 million of revenue related to Bundled Offerings. During fiscal year 2013, we recognized $540 million of previously deferred revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. The revenue was recognized upon expiration of the offer. Corporate and Other gross margin decreased $866 million, due mainly to decreased revenue. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Corporate and Other revenue increased $888 million or 183%, primarily due to the timing of revenue deferrals. During fiscal year 2013, we recognized $540 million of revenue that had been deferred in fiscal year\n\n2012 related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. The revenue was recognized upon expiration of the offer. Corporate and Other gross margin increased $954 million or 164%, due mainly to increased revenue.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Table of Contents PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition,\n\nand that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent\n\ndirectors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer Amy E. Hood Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Frank H. Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer 50 Table of Contents PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are\n\nof investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio\n\nreturns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. VALUE-AT-RISK We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary\n\nlosses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level or, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several\n\nrisk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. 51\n\nItem 7A.

Hood Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Frank H. Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer 50 Table of Contents PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are\n\nexposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Interest Rate Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily\n\nof investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio\n\ncategories above. Commercial Our Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and services designed to increase individual, team, and organizational productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless operations across the user’s hardware and software. Our Commercial segments are: • Commercial Licensing, comprising: server products, including Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); Windows Embedded; volume licensing of the Windows operating system, excluding academic (“Windows Commercial”); Microsoft Office for business, including Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, and related CALs (“Office Commercial”); Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, excluding Dynamics CRM Online; and Skype; and\n\n• Commercial Other, comprising: Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services; Commercial Cloud, comprising Office 365 Commercial, other Microsoft Office online offerings, Dynamics CRM Online, and Microsoft Azure; and certain other commercial products and online services not included in the categories above. Revenue and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. Certain revenue contracts are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services. Cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware segments. For the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most cases and\n\nallocated in certain cases, generally using a relative revenue methodology. We do not allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our two segment groups, Devices and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises or in the cloud. Operating expenses are attributed to our segment groups as follows: • Sales\n\nand marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment. • Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group. 92 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 • General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segment groups, including costs of: legal, including expenses, settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and\n\nintegration and restructuring costs. Segment revenue and gross margin were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Revenue Devices and Consumer Licensing $ 18,803 $ 19,021 $ 19,495 Hardware: Computing and Gaming Hardware 9,628 6,461 6,740 Phone Hardware 1,985 0 0 Total D&C Hardware 11,613 6,461 6,740 Other 7,258 6,618 6,203 Total Devices and Consumer 37,674 32,100 32,438 Commercial Licensing 42,027 39,686 37,126 Other 7,547 5,660 4,644 Total Commercial 49,574 45,346 41,770 Corporate and Other (415) 403 (485) Total revenue $ 86,833 $ 77,849 $ 73,723 (In millions) Year Ended June 30,\n\nrecognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities,\n\nwhich are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than- temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) into other income (expense). Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Balance, beginning of period $ 336 $ 389 $\n\n333 Charged to costs and other 16 4 115 Write-offs (51) (57) (59) Balance, end of period $ 301 $ 336 $ 389 Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n\nThe determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, two to 20 years; and furniture\n\nand equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Intangible Assets All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the\n\nand marketing expenses are primarily recorded directly to each segment group based on identified customer segment. • Research and development expenses are primarily shared across the segment groups based on relative gross margin but are mapped directly in certain cases where the value of the expense only accrues to that segment group. 92 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 • General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated based on relative gross margin.
