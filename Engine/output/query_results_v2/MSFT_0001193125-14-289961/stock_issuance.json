The weighted average grant-date fair value was $37.64. As of June 30, 2014, there was approximately $5.2 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards.

Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three- month period. Employees may purchase shares having a\n\nvalue not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented: (Shares in millions) Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Shares purchased 18 20 20 Average price per share $ 33.60 $ 26.81 $ 25.03 At June 30, 2014, 173 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the Plan. Savings Plan We have a savings plan in the U.S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up\n\nto 75% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the given year. Matching contributions for all plans were $420 million, $393 million, and $373 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan.

At June 30, 2014, an aggregate of 346 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards, and leadership stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares\n\ngenerally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our stock plans. Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012 Stock-based compensation expense $ 2,446 $ 2,406 $ 2,244 Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation $ 830 $ 842 $ 785 Stock Plans Stock awards Stock awards (“SAs”) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. SAs generally vest over a\n\nfour or five-year period. 89 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Executive incentive plan Under the Executive Incentive Plan (“EIP”), the Compensation Committee awards performance-based compensation comprising both cash and SAs to executive officers and certain senior executives. For executive officers, their awards are based on an aggregate incentive pool equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. For fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, the pool was 0.44%, 0.35%, and 0.30% of operating income, respectively. The SAs vest ratably in August of each of the four years following the grant date. The final cash awards will be determined\n\n8 based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Financial Instruments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values.\n\nIn general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt\n\nand equity instruments. With the exception of certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Held-to- maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment\n\nreturns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and\n\nqualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions"
