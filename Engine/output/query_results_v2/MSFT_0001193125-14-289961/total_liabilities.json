In March 2014, defendants filed a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs’ general causation testimony on the ground that it is pre- empted by federal law because the experts challenge the safety of all cellular handsets, including those that comply with the FCC Guidelines. Both motions are pending. Canadian cell phone class action Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia\n\nby a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served. Other We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are\n\nsubject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2014, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $780 million in other current liabilities and $81 million in other long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of that date. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $2.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the\n\nperiod in which the effects become reasonably estimable. Substantially all changes from the prior quarter in these accruals and estimates are attributable to matters involving Nokia that we assumed as a result of the NDS acquisition.
