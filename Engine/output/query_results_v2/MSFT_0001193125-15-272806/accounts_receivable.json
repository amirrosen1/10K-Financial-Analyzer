For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives\n\nentered into for investment 62 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) into other income (expense), net. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience,\n\nand other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2015 2014 2013 Balance, beginning of period $ 301 $ 336 $ 389 Charged to costs and other 77 16 4 Write-offs (43) (51) (57) Balance, end of period $ 335 $ 301 $ 336 Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and\n\nthe estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows:\n\ncomputer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n\nmeasured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\n\ngains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.

The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows:\n\nand 2013, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software was $79 million, $200 million, and $210 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held at June 30, 2015: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2016 $ 910 2017 755 2018 670 2019 554 2020 495 Thereafter 1,451 Total $ 4,835 NOTE 12 — DEBT Short-term Debt As of June 30, 2015, we had $5.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from 8 days to 63 days.\n\nAs of June 30, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities ranging from 86 to 91 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on November 4, 2015 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2015, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at\n\nleast three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented. Long-term Debt As of June 30, 2015, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $30.3 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our long- term debt of $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2\n\ninputs. 78 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 The components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows as of June 30, 2015 and 2014: Face Value Face Value Stated Effective June 30, June 30, Interest Interest Due Date 2015 2014 Rate Rate (In millions) Notes September 25, 2015 $ 1,750 $ 1,750 1.625% 1.795% February 8, 2016 750 750 2.500% 2.642% November 15, 2017 600 600 0.875% 1.084% May 1, 2018 450 450 1.000% 1.106% December 6, 2018 1,250 1,250 1.625% 1.824% June 1, 2019 1,000 1,000 4.200% 4.379% February\n\n12, 2020 (a) 1,500 0 1.850% 1.935% October 1, 2020 1,000 1,000 3.000% 3.137% February 8, 2021 500 500 4.000% 4.082% December 6, 2021 (b) 1,950 2,396 2.125% 2.233% February 12, 2022 (a) 1,500 0 2.375% 2.466% November 15, 2022 750 750 2.125% 2.239% May 1, 2023 1,000 1,000 2.375% 2.465% December 15, 2023 1,500 1,500 3.625% 3.726% February 12, 2025 (a) 2,250 0 2.700% 2.772% December 6, 2028 (b) 1,950 2,396 3.125% 3.218% May 2, 2033 (b) 613 753 2.625% 2.690% February 12, 2035 (a) 1,500 0 3.500% 3.604% June 1, 2039 750 750 5.200% 5.240% October 1, 2040"
