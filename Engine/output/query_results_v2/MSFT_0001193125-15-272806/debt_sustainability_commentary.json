BUSINESS GENERAL Our vision Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. The mobile-first, cloud-first world is transforming the way individuals and organizations use and interact with technology. Our worldview for mobile-first is not about the mobility of devices; it is centered on the mobility of experiences that, in turn, are orchestrated by the cloud. Cloud computing and storage solutions\n\nthe cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers, unify the cross-device user experience, and increase agility when bringing new advances to market. • Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. • Developing new devices that have increasingly natural ways to interact with them, including speech, pen, gesture, and augmented reality holograms. • Applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf, instead of at our command. We believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large global partner and customer base,\n\nour growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas and differentiate ourselves from competitors. 5 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business in six segments. Our Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) segments include D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other. Our Commercial segments include Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide\n\na framework for timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our transformation in the mobile-first, cloud-first world. As we evolve how we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure, it is possible that our segments may change. On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services Business (“NDS”). We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our\n\njoint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Devices and Consumer Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect\n\nwith audiences. Our D&C segments are made up of D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other. D&C Licensing The principal products and services provided by the D&C Licensing segment are: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue. The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for\n\nmethods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. 12 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 Investing in the Future Microsoft’s success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption\n\nof our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long-term research and development, we maintain our long- term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, and devices operating systems and hardware. While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and\n\ndevelopment facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and the United Kingdom, among others. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the business segment level. Much of our business segment level research and development is coordinated with\n\nother segments and leveraged across the company. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest computer science research organizations, and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science, providing us a unique perspective on future technology trends and contributing to our innovation. DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs; distributors and resellers; online; and Microsoft retail stores. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working\n\ndirectly with enterprises and public sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their software requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting solution integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products. OEMs We distribute software through OEMs that pre-install our software on new PCs, tablets, servers, phones, and other intelligent devices that they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre- installed on computing devices. OEMs also sell hardware pre-installed with other Microsoft products, including server and embedded operating systems and\n\ninstalling Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed. In addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products\n\nor services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests\n\nof a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we\n\nmay be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market\n\ncapitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous Online Services Division business (Devices and Consumer Other under our current segment structure), and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we\n\nkey performance indicators. • Announcements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and competitive strategies. Archives of these events are also available. • Press releases on quarterly earnings, product and service announcements, legal developments, and international news. • Corporate governance information including our articles of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, committee charters, codes of conduct and ethics, global corporate citizenship initiatives, and other governance- related policies. • Other news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting. • Opportunities to sign up for email\n\nalerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website. 17 Table of Contents PART I\n\nItem 1A ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying\n\ntechnical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users,\n\napplication developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products\n\nof a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we\n\nmay be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market\n\ncapitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, we recorded a $6.2 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill in our previous Online Services Division business (Devices and Consumer Other under our current segment structure), and in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we\n\nrecorded a $5.1 billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and a $2.2 billion charge for the impairment of intangible assets in our Phone Hardware segment. 20 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A We may not earn the revenues we expect from our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly in countries\n\nwhere laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. We may not receive expected royalties from our\n\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Table of Contents PART I Item 1A subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where\n\nthe ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income\n\nfrom outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems. Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as\n\nItem 1B.

In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems. Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as\n\nXbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry\n\nshortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. Our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop\n\nmay contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes\n\nfrom international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the\n\nsales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the 25\n\n$7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during fiscal year 2014 to $32.2 billion, mainly due to\n\nincreases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $246 million to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $2.0 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, and a $324 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, offset in part by a $3.4 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing decreased $5.0 billion to $18.8 billion, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $4.4\n\nbillion increase in cash used for acquisition of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $1.2 billion increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment. Debt We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial\n\nStatements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue at June 30, 2015 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2015 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox Live subscriptions and prepaid points;\n\nMicrosoft Dynamics business solutions products; Office 365 subscriptions; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; Bundled Offerings; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2015: (In millions) Three Months Ending, September 30, 2015 $ 8,889 December 31, 2015 7,172 March 31, 2016 4,848 June 30, 2016 2,314 Thereafter 2,095 Total $ 25,318 44 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Share Repurchases On September 16,\n\nDirectors on September 16, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, we repurchased 175 million shares for $6.4 billion; 128 million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013, and 47 million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and expired September 30, 2013. During fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 158 million shares for $4.6 billion, under the share repurchase program announced on September 22, 2008. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Dividends See Note 19 –\n\nStockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements\n\nduring the periods presented. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2015: (In millions) 2016 2017-2018 2019-2020 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 2,500 $ 1,050 $ 3,750 $ 23,163 $ 30,463 Interest payments 855 1,641 1,552 11,412 15,460 Construction commitments (b) 681 0 0 0 681 Operating leases (c) 863 1,538 1,135 1,617 5,153 Purchase commitments (d) 13,018 989 164 261 14,432 Other long-term liabilities (e) 0 237 75 639 951 Total contractual obligations $ 17,917 $ 5,455 $ 6,676 $ 37,092 $\n\n67,140 (a) See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (b) These amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements. (c) These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases. (d) These amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take- or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (e) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, deferred income taxes, and long-term pension liabilities of $15.2 billion from the amounts presented.\n\nWe have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. 45 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for\n\n$655 million in fiscal year 2014, while Microsoft Office system and server products and tools revenue increased $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, during this same period. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, our U.S. income before income taxes was $7.1 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, and comprised 26% and 25%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the foreign income before income taxes was $20.7 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 74% and 75%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and\n\nshort-term investments totaled $96.5 billion as of June 30, 2015, compared with $85.7 billion as of June 30, 2014. Equity and other investments were $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2015, compared with $14.6 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our short-term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital 42 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest\n\nrate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 30, 2015, $94.4 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short- term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow\n\nof funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.1 billion. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 79% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Securities lending We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are\n\nreceived as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $92 million as of June 30, 2015. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $287 million and $750 million, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value,\n\nwe reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment. 49 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\n\nStates of America.
