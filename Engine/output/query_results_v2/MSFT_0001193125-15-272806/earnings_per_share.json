Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted. We anticipate\n\nthis standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are currently evaluating its impact. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:\n\n(In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2015 2014 2013 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 12,193 $ 22,074 $ 21,863 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 8,177 8,299 8,375 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 77 100 95 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 8,254 8,399 8,470 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 1.49 $ 2.66 $ 2.61 Diluted (A/C) $ 1.48 $ 2.63 $ 2.58 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented.

The total VaR is 29% less at June 30, 2015, and 25% less at June 30, 2014, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks. 52 Table of Contents PART\n\nII Item 8 ITEM 8.

Under the new standard, recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is permitted.
