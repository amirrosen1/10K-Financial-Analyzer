These increases were offset in part by a decline in revenue from Office Commercial, Windows OEM, licensing of Windows Phone operating system, and Office Consumer. Revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%. Gross margin increased $787 million or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part\n\nby a $6.0 billion or 22% increase in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased, mainly due to Phone Hardware, as well as increasing costs in support of our Commercial Cloud, including $396 million of higher datacenter expenses. Gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, improved year over year in each of our reportable segments. 32 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Operating income decreased $9.6 billion or 35%, primarily due to impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in the current year, as well as increased research and development expenses, offset in part by higher gross margin. Key changes in\n\noperating expenses were: • Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion in the current year, reflecting goodwill and asset impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware business, and $2.5 billion of integration and restructuring expenses, driven by costs associated with our restructuring plans. • Research and development expenses increased $665 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services, including NDS expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses. Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were negatively impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which decreased diluted EPS by $1.15. Fiscal year 2014\n\ncompared with fiscal year 2013 Revenue increased $9.0 billion or 12%, demonstrating growth across our consumer and commercial businesses, primarily due to higher revenue from server products, Xbox Platform, Commercial Cloud, and Surface. Revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud- based offerings. Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface devices sold, and $575 million\n\nof higher datacenter expenses, primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were: • Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services in our Devices engineering group, including NDS expenses, and increased investment in our Applications and Services engineering group. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $535 million\n\noperating expenses were: • Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion in the current year, reflecting goodwill and asset impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware business, and $2.5 billion of integration and restructuring expenses, driven by costs associated with our restructuring plans. • Research and development expenses increased $665 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services, including NDS expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses.

Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Sales and marketing expenses decreased $98 million or 1%, primarily due to a decline in advertising and marketing programs costs and a reduction in headcount-related expenses, offset in part by an increase in NDS expenses. Sales and marketing expenses included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately 4%. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Sales and marketing expenses increased $535 million or\n\n4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased investment in sales resources, offset in part by lower advertising costs. NDS sales and marketing expenses were $394 million during fiscal year 2014. Average headcount, excluding NDS, grew 4%. Advertising costs, excluding NDS, declined $403 million or 15%, primarily due to Windows 8 and Surface costs in the prior year. 39 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 General and Administrative Percentage Percentage Change 2015 Change 2014 (In millions, except percentages) 2015 2014 2013 Versus 2014 Versus 2013 General and administrative $ 4,611 $ 4,677 $ 5,013 (1)% (7)% As a percent\n\nof revenue 5% 5% 6% 0ppt (1)ppt General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, severance expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative personnel, certain taxes, and legal and other administrative fees. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 General and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 General and administrative expenses decreased $336 million or 7%, mainly due to the European Commission fine in the prior year, offset in part by higher business taxes, higher costs for\n\ninternal use software capitalized in the prior year, and NDS expenses. NDS general and administrative expenses were $77 million during fiscal year 2014. IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses include costs associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our Phone Hardware business, employee severance expenses and costs associated with the consolidation of facilities and manufacturing operations related to restructuring activities, and systems consolidation and other business integration expenses associated with our acquisition of NDS. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses were $10.0 billion for fiscal\n\nyear 2015, compared to $127 million for fiscal year 2014. The increase was mainly due to impairment charges of $7.5 billion related to our Phone Hardware business in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Our annual goodwill impairment test as of May 1, 2015 indicated that the carrying value of Phone Hardware goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.1 billion, reducing Phone Hardware’s goodwill from $5.4 billion to $116 million, net of foreign currency remeasurements, as well as an impairment charge of $2.2 billion related to the write-down of Phone Hardware\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value,\n\nwe reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. The determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment. 49 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\n\nStates of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and\n\ninternal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting.

For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly\n\nreevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before\n\nthe products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based\n\non the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. 60 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase\n\nand is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The\n\nconsoles, games published by us, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when\n\nthe action necessary to earn the revenue has been 59 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or services. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and\n\nprograms licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and\n\nsoftware warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software.
