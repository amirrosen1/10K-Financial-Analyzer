(c) These amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases. (d) These amounts represent purchase commitments, including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take- or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (e) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, deferred income taxes, and long-term pension liabilities of $15.2 billion from the amounts presented.\n\nWe have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. 45 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, data centers, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our productivity and platform strategy. We have operating leases for\n\nmost U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Liquidity We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a\n\nneed to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such\n\nItem 7A.

Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and\n\nsoftware warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly\n\nreevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before\n\nthe products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based\n\non the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. 60 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase\n\nsoftware warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.

Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase\n\nand is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

These corporate notes are due October 31, 2023 and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of June 30, 2015, the amortized cost and recorded basis of these corporate notes were both $25 million with an estimated fair value that approximates the carrying value. As of June 30, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164 million. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred\n\nstock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $561 million and $520 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined\n\nbased upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. As of June 30, 2015, collateral received under these agreements totaled $92 million which is comprised of $79 million of certificates of deposit and $13 million of U.S. government and agency securities. The contractual maturities of these agreements are primarily on a continuous and overnight basis. 66 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Unrealized Losses on Investments Investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows: Less than 12 Months 12 Months or\n\nGreater Total Unrealized Unrealized Total Unrealized (In millions) Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses June 30, 2015 U.S. government and agency securities $ 6,636 $ (9) $ 421 $ (21) $ 7,057 $ (30) Foreign government bonds 4,611 (12) 18 (12) 4,629 (24) Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 3,171 $ (5) 28 (1) 3,199 (6) Corporate notes and bonds 2,946 (29) 104 (8) 3,050 (37) Municipal securities 36 (1) 0 0 36 (1) Common and preferred stock 1,389 (180) 148 (35) 1,537 (215) Total $ 18,789 $ (236) $ 719 $ (77) $ 19,508 $ (313) Less than"
