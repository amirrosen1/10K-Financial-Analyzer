The addition of Minecraft and its community enhances our gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and other ecosystems besides our own. Our purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available, including additional information relating to tax matters and finalization\n\nof our valuation of identified intangible assets. The significant classes of assets and liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of $928 million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) Other segment. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been included in our consolidated results of operations\n\nHardware Integration Plan were completed as of June 30, 2015. 82 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 In connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.3 billion during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets. Phone Hardware Restructuring In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our Phone Hardware business to better focus and align resources (the “Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan”), under which we will eliminate up to 7,800 positions in fiscal year 2016. In connection with the Phone\n\nHardware Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring charges of $780 million during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily related to contractual obligations. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan are expected to be completed as of June 30, 2016. Restructuring charges associated with each plan were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note 22 — Segment Information and Geographic Data. Changes in the restructuring liability were as follows: Asset Impairments (In\n\nmillions) Severance and Other (a) Total Restructuring liability as of June 30, 2014 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Restructuring charges 1,308 770 2,078 Cash paid (701) (134) (835) Other (19) (387) (406) Restructuring liability as of June 30, 2015 $ 588 $ 249 $ 837 (a) “Asset Impairments and Other” primarily reflects activities associated with the consolidation of our facilities and manufacturing operations, including asset write-downs of $372 million during fiscal year 2015, as well as contract termination costs.

We have operating leases for most U.S.\n\nand international sales and support offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases was $989 million, $874 million, and $711 million, in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable facilities operating leases in place as of June 30, 2015 are as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2016 $ 863 2017 803 2018 735 2019 611 2020 524 Thereafter 1,617 Total $ 5,153 Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by\n\nprograms licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and\n\nsoftware warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly\n\nreevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before\n\nthe products are released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based\n\non the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line method. 60 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase"
