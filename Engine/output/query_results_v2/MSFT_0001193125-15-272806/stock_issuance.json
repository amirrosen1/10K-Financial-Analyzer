These corporate notes are due October 31, 2023 and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of June 30, 2015, the amortized cost and recorded basis of these corporate notes were both $25 million with an estimated fair value that approximates the carrying value. As of June 30, 2014, the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164 million. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred\n\nstock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $561 million and $520 million, respectively. These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined\n\nbased upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. As of June 30, 2015, collateral received under these agreements totaled $92 million which is comprised of $79 million of certificates of deposit and $13 million of U.S. government and agency securities. The contractual maturities of these agreements are primarily on a continuous and overnight basis. 66 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Unrealized Losses on Investments Investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows: Less than 12 Months 12 Months or\n\nGreater Total Unrealized Unrealized Total Unrealized (In millions) Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses June 30, 2015 U.S. government and agency securities $ 6,636 $ (9) $ 421 $ (21) $ 7,057 $ (30) Foreign government bonds 4,611 (12) 18 (12) 4,629 (24) Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 3,171 $ (5) 28 (1) 3,199 (6) Corporate notes and bonds 2,946 (29) 104 (8) 3,050 (37) Municipal securities 36 (1) 0 0 36 (1) Common and preferred stock 1,389 (180) 148 (35) 1,537 (215) Total $ 18,789 $ (236) $ 719 $ (77) $ 19,508 $ (313) Less than\n\naction lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served. Other We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually\n\nor in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2015, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $614 million in other current liabilities and $20 million in other long-term liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our\n\nconsolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.
