We believe the breadth of our products and services portfolio, our large global partner and customer base,\n\nour growing ecosystem, and our ongoing investment in innovation position us to be a leader in these areas and differentiate ourselves from competitors. 5 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business in six segments. Our Devices and Consumer (“D&C”) segments include D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other. Our Commercial segments include Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide\n\na framework for timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. In June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure as part of our transformation in the mobile-first, cloud-first world. As we evolve how we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure, it is possible that our segments may change. On April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s (“Nokia”) Devices and Services Business (“NDS”). We report the financial performance of the acquired business in our Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our\n\njoint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Devices and Consumer Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect\n\nwith audiences. Our D&C segments are made up of D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other. D&C Licensing The principal products and services provided by the D&C Licensing segment are: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue. The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for\n\non-demand CRM offerings. The Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. OPERATIONS We have operations centers that support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale,\n\nFlorida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate data centers throughout the Americas, Australia, Europe, and Asia. To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. 11 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 We operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly\n\nin Vietnam. Our Xbox consoles, Surface, first-party video games, Microsoft PC accessories, and other hardware are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT During fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, research and development expense was $12.0 billion, $11.4 billion, and $10.4 billion, respectively. These amounts represented 13% of revenue in each of those years. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. Product and Service Development and Intellectual\n\nProperty We develop most of our products and services internally through three engineering groups. • Applications and Services Engineering Group, focuses on broad applications and services core technologies in productivity, communication, education, search, and other information categories. • Cloud and Enterprise Engineering Group, focuses on development of our cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, enterprise resource planning, management, development tools, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. • Windows and Devices Engineering Group, focuses on our Windows platform across devices of all types, hardware development of our devices, including Xbox consoles, Surface devices, Lumia phones, non-Lumia phones, Surface Hub,\n\nMicrosoft Band, and other hardware products and accessories, and associated online marketplaces. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also\n\njoint strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D&C Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in conjunction with the acquisition. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Devices and Consumer Our D&C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect\n\nwith audiences. Our D&C segments are made up of D&C Licensing, Computing and Gaming Hardware, Phone Hardware, and D&C Other. D&C Licensing The principal products and services provided by the D&C Licensing segment are: Windows, including all OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing and academic volume licensing of the Windows operating system and related software; non-volume licensing of Microsoft Office, comprising the core Office product set, for consumers (“Office Consumer”); Windows Phone operating system, including related patent licensing; and certain other patent licensing revenue. The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for\n\nusers by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows revenue is impacted by: • The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size. • Differences in device market demand between developed markets and emerging markets. • Attachment of Windows to devices shipped. • Customer mix between consumer, small- and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises. • Changes in inventory levels in the OEM\n\nchannel. • Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large, multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed. • Piracy. 6 Table of Contents PART I Item 1 The versions of Office included in our D&C Licensing segment are designed to increase personal productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth depends on our ability to add value to the core product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other areas such as content management and collaboration. Office\n\nConsumer revenue is impacted by sales to customers that buy Office with their new devices and by product launches, as well as the transition to Office 365 Consumer, our subscription-based cloud service that provides access to Office plus other productivity services. Office 365 Consumer revenue is included in our D&C Other segment. The Windows Phone operating system is designed to bring users closer to the people, applications, and content they need. As noted above, prior to our acquisition of NDS, Microsoft and Nokia jointly created new mobile products and services and extended established products and services to new markets through\n\naccountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. The Company’s increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: • Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. • Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our\n\ncloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices. • Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. • Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. • Making our suite of cloud-based services platform agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and\n\ntechnical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. 19 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A We make significant investments in new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows\n\nServer, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office 365, other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may\n\nnot achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users\n\ndata, our 22 Table of Contents PART I Item 1A training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of customer data we or our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers to store and process personal data on- premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require\n\nus to produce customer data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer data, perceptions that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer expectations\n\nor governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses. We may have outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services\n\nsuch as Bing, Exchange Online, Office 365, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft Azure, Outlook.com, Windows Stores, and Microsoft Account services. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our\n\nproducts, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm our operating results and financial condition. Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such\n\nkey performance indicators. • Announcements of investor conferences, speeches, and events at which our executives talk about our product, service, and competitive strategies. Archives of these events are also available. • Press releases on quarterly earnings, product and service announcements, legal developments, and international news. • Corporate governance information including our articles of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, committee charters, codes of conduct and ethics, global corporate citizenship initiatives, and other governance- related policies. • Other news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting. • Opportunities to sign up for email\n\nalerts and RSS feeds to have information pushed in real time. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website. 17 Table of Contents PART I\n\nItem 1A ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying\n\ntechnical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users,\n\napplication developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products\n\nfrom outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems. Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as\n\nXbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry\n\nshortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer. Our software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop\n\nmay contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes\n\nfrom international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the\n\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Table of Contents PART I Item 1A subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where\n\nthe ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income\n\nfrom outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.

Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were negatively impacted by impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, which decreased diluted EPS by $1.15. Fiscal year 2014\n\ncompared with fiscal year 2013 Revenue increased $9.0 billion or 12%, demonstrating growth across our consumer and commercial businesses, primarily due to higher revenue from server products, Xbox Platform, Commercial Cloud, and Surface. Revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Commercial Cloud revenue doubled, reflecting continued subscriber growth from our cloud- based offerings. Gross margin increased $2.3 billion or 4%, primarily due to higher revenue, offset in part by a $6.7 billion or 33% increase in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to higher volumes of Xbox consoles and Surface devices sold, and $575 million\n\nof higher datacenter expenses, primarily in support of Commercial Cloud revenue growth. Cost of revenue also increased due to the acquisition of NDS. Operating income increased $995 million or 4%, reflecting higher gross margin, offset in part by increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were: • Research and development expenses increased $970 million or 9%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services in our Devices engineering group, including NDS expenses, and increased investment in our Applications and Services engineering group. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $535 million\n\nor 4%, primarily due to NDS expenses and increased investment in sales resources, offset in part by lower advertising costs. 33 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Devices and Consumer Percentage Percentage Change 2015 Change 2014 (In millions, except percentages) 2015 2014 2013 Versus 2014 Versus 2013 Revenue Licensing $ 14,969 $ 19,528 $ 19,427 (23)% 1% Hardware: Computing and Gaming Hardware 10,183 9,093 6,149 12% 48% Phone Hardware 7,524 1,982 0 * * Total Devices and Consumer Hardware 17,707 11,075 6,149 60% 80% Other 8,825 7,014 6,431 26% 9% Total Devices and Consumer revenue\n\n$ 41,501 $ 37,617 $ 32,007 10% 18% Gross Margin Licensing $ 13,870 $ 17,439 $ 16,985 (20)% 3% Hardware: Computing and Gaming Hardware 1,788 892 956 100% (7)% Phone Hardware 701 54 0 * * Total Devices and Consumer Hardware 2,489 946 956 163% (1)% Other 2,022 1,393 1,951 45% (29)% Total Devices and Consumer gross margin $ 18,381 $ 19,778 $ 19,892 (7)% (1)% * Not meaningful Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 D&C revenue increased $3.9 billion or 10%, primarily due to a full year of Phone Hardware sales, as well as higher revenue from\n\nOther revenue decreased $818 million, primarily due to the timing of revenue deferrals.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and\n\nshould be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements. OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology leader focused on building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We strive to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We develop and market software, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to people’s lives. We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products, by offering an array of services, including cloud-based services to consumers and businesses, by designing,\n\nmanufacturing, and selling devices that integrate with our cloud-based services, and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience.
