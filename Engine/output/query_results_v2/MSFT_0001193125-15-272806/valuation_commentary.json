Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would\n\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a\n\n47 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and\n\ngoodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing as of May 1, 2015, we determined that goodwill associated with our Phone Hardware reporting unit was impaired, resulting in a material charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. As of June 30, 2015, none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of impairment. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established,\n\nall software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nassets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange- traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, foreign government bonds, mortgage-\n\nand asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available,\n\nthe investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all of our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review\n\nof key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. 43 Table of Contents PART II Item 7 Cash Flows Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Cash flows from operations decreased $3.2 billion during the fiscal year to $29.1 billion, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs in support of sales growth as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital, offset in part by increases in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing increased $686 million to $9.1 billion, mainly due to a\n\n$7.1 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by a $6.7 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments. Cash used in investing increased $4.2 billion to $23.0 billion, mainly due to a $5.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, partially offset by a $2.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 Cash flows from operations increased $3.4 billion during fiscal year 2014 to $32.2 billion, mainly due to\n\nof funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.1 billion. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 79% of the cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 5% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, and approximately 5% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Securities lending We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are\n\nreceived as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $92 million as of June 30, 2015. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were $287 million and $750 million, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical\n\nassets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as exchange- traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, and U.S. government securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly.

Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. With the exception of certain corporate notes that are classified as held-to-maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Held-to- maturity investments are recorded and held at amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other investments that\n\nare restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be\n\nother-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether\n\nwe have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are\n\nmeasured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\n\nTotal $ 81,750 $ 22,761 $ 20 $ 104,531 $ (162) $ 104,369 Liabilities Derivatives and other $ 5 $ 159 $ 54 $ 218 $ (161) $ 57 Gross Fair Net Fair (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value Netting (a) Value June 30, 2014 Assets Mutual funds $ 590 $ 0 $ 0 $ 590 $ 0 $ 590 Commercial paper 0 189 0 189 0 189 Certificates of deposit 0 1,197 0 1,197 0 1,197 U.S. government and agency securities 66,288 745 0 67,033 0 67,033 Foreign government bonds 139 3,210 0 3,349 0 3,349\n\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities 0 1,015 0 1,015 0 1,015 Corporate notes and bonds 0 6,863 0 6,863 0 6,863 Municipal securities 0 332 0 332 0 332 Common and preferred stock 9,552 1,825 14 11,391 0 11,391 Derivatives 5 348 7 360 (155) 205 Total $ 76,574 $ 15,724 $ 21 $ 92,319 $ (155) $ 92,164 Liabilities Derivatives and other $ 5 $ 153 $ 126 $ 284 $ (155) $ 129 (a) These amounts represent the impact of netting derivative assets and derivative liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related\n\nto our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk.

Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test (“Step 2”) was performed specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared\n\nto the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in valuing the tangible assets. No other instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test. No impairment of goodwill was identified as of May 1, 2014.

We estimate that we have no significant residual value\n\nrelated to our intangible assets. During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion related to our Phone Hardware intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested the intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We primarily used a relief\n\nfrom royalty income approach to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment. These intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment group in Note 22 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. No material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 2014. 77 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 The components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows: Weighted Weighted (In millions) Amount"
