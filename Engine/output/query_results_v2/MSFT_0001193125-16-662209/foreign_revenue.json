In fiscal year 2015, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our phone business\n\nof $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Federal statutory rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (19.4)% (20.9)% (17.1)% Phone nondeductible charges and valuation allowance 1.3% 19.1% 0.9% Domestic production activities deduction (0.6)% (2.4)% (1.0)% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation (2.0)% 0% 0% Other reconciling items, net 0.7% 3.3% 2.9% Effective rate 15.0% 34.1% 20.7% 81 Table of Contents PART II Item 8\n\nThe reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 69%, 73%, and 81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant\n\nother reconciling items. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock- based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a\n\nresult of impairment and restructuring charges. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2016 2015 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 809 $ 884 Other expense items 1,609 1,531 Restructuring charges 284 211 Unearned revenue 494 520 Impaired investments 226 257 Loss carryforwards 1,703 1,158 Depreciation and amortization 115 798 Other revenue items 89 56 Deferred income tax assets 5,329 5,415 Less valuation allowance (2,180) (2,265) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 3,149 $ 3,150 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Foreign earnings $ (1,242) $ (1,280)\n\nGeographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change primarily impacted Note 10 – Goodwill, Note 15 – Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible\n\nassets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes\n\nmay differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”). 57 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Service revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our\n\nconsolidated income statements. Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from\n\nonline advertising. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are\n\nabove are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. Interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $1.1 billion, $620 million, and $509 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long- term debt, including the current portion, was $166 million and $156 million, respectively. 80 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Maturities of our long-term debt for each of\n\nthe next five years and thereafter are as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2017 $ 0 2018 1,050 2019 4,000 2020 1,500 2021 3,750 Thereafter 30,649 Total $ 40,949 NOTE 13 — INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 545 $ 3,661 $ 3,738 U.S. state and local 136 364 266 Foreign 1,940 2,065 2,073 Current taxes 2,621 6,090 6,077 Deferred Taxes Deferred taxes 332 224 (331) Provision for income taxes $ 2,953 $ 6,314 $ 5,746 U.S.\n\nand foreign components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 U.S. $ (325) $ 7,363 $ 7,127 Foreign 20,076 11,144 20,693 Income before income taxes $ 19,751 $ 18,507 $ 27,820 In fiscal year 2016, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.0 billion and $588 million, respectively.
