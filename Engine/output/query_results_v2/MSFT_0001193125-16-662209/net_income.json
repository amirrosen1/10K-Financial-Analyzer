Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes\n\nmay differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”). 57 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Service revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product revenue and service and other revenue on our\n\nconsolidated income statements. Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“Azure”), Microsoft Dynamics (“Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from\n\nonline advertising. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are\n\ndelivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE\n\n13 Commodity contracts (87) (223) 71 Total $ (154) $ (703) $ (34) 72 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 NOTE 6 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following tables present the fair value of our financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: Gross Fair Net Fair (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value Netting (a) Value June 30, 2016 Assets Mutual funds $ 1,012 $ 0 $ 0 $ 1,012 $ 0 $ 1,012 Commercial paper 0 298 0 298 0\n\n298 Certificates of deposit 0 1,000 0 1,000 0 1,000 U.S. government and agency securities 86,492 3,707 0 90,199 0 90,199 Foreign government bonds 10 5,705 0 5,715 0 5,715 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 0 4,803 0 4,803 0 4,803 Corporate notes and bonds 0 6,361 1 6,362 0 6,362 Municipal securities 0 342 0 342 0 342 Common and preferred stock 6,918 2,114 18 9,050 0 9,050 Derivatives 6 633 0 639 (401) 238 Total $ 94,438 $ 24,963 $ 19 $ 119,420 $ (401) $ 119,019 Liabilities Derivatives and other $ 17 $ 613 $ 0 $ 630\n\n$ (398) $ 232 Gross Fair Net Fair (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value Netting (a) Value June 30, 2015 Assets Mutual funds $ 1,100 $ 0 $ 0 $ 1,100 $ 0 $ 1,100 Commercial paper 0 1 0 1 0 1 Certificates of deposit 0 906 0 906 0 906 U.S. government and agency securities 71,930 955 0 72,885 0 72,885 Foreign government bonds 131 5,299 0 5,430 0 5,430 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 0 4,917 0 4,917 0 4,917 Corporate notes and bonds 0 7,108 1 7,109 0 7,109 Municipal securities 0 319 0\n\n319 0 319 Common and preferred stock 8,585 2,277 14 10,876 0 10,876 Derivatives 4 979 5 988 (162) 826 Total $ 81,750 $ 22,761 $ 20 $ 104,531 $ (162) $ 104,369 Liabilities Derivatives and other $ 5 $ 159 $ 54 $ 218 $ (161) $ 57 (a) These amounts represent the impact of netting derivative assets and derivative liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk.
