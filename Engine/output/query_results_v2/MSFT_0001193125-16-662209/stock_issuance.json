These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators\n\nof other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these investments. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the collateral received under agreements for loaned securities totaled $294 million and $92 million, which is primarily comprised of U.S. government and agency securities. 67 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Unrealized Losses on Investments Investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows: Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Unrealized Unrealized Total Unrealized (In millions) Fair\n\nValue Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses June 30, 2016 U.S. government and agency securities $ 5,816 $ (3) $ 432 $ (8) $ 6,248 $ (11) Foreign government bonds 3,452 (3) 35 (15) 3,487 (18) Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 844 (1) 322 (1) 1,166 (2) Corporate notes and bonds 1,180 (11) 788 (24) 1,968 (35) Common and preferred stock 896 (147) 390 (89) 1,286 (236) Total $ 12,188 $ (165) $ 1,967 $ (137) $ 14,155 $ (302) Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Unrealized Unrealized Total Unrealized (In millions) Fair Value Losses Fair Value\n\nthe future. As of June 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. 87 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property\n\ninfringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements.
