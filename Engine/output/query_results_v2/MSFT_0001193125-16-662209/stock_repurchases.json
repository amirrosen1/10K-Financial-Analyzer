We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements.

As of June 30, 2016, $7.1 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. We repurchased the following shares of common stock under the above-described repurchase plans: (In millions) Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount Year Ended June 30, 2016 2015 2014 (a) First quarter 89 $ 4,000 43 $ 2,000 47 $ 1,500 Second quarter 66 3,600 43 2,000 53 2,000 Third quarter 69 3,600 116 5,000 47 1,791 Fourth quarter 70 3,600 93 4,209 28\n\n1,118 Total 294 $ 14,800 295 $ 13,209 175 $ 6,409 (a) Of the 175 million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2014, 128 million shares were repurchased for $4.9 billion under the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on September 16, 2013 and 47 million shares were repurchased for $1.5 billion under the share repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008 and expired on September 30, 2013. The above table excludes shares repurchased to settle statutory employee tax withholding related to the vesting of stock awards. 88 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Dividends\n\nIn fiscal year 2016, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends: Dividend Declaration Date Per Share Record Date Total Amount Payment Date (In millions) September 15, 2015 $ 0.36 November 19, 2015 $ 2,868 December 10, 2015 December 2, 2015 $ 0.36 February 18, 2016 $ 2,842 March 10, 2016 March 15, 2016 $ 0.36 May 19, 2016 $ 2,821 June 9, 2016 June 14, 2016 $ 0.36 August 18, 2016 $ 2,811 September 8, 2016 The dividend declared on June 14, 2016 will be paid after the filing date of the 2016 Form 10-K and was included in\n\nthe future. As of June 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. 87 Table of Contents PART II Item 8 Indemnifications We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property\n\ninfringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
