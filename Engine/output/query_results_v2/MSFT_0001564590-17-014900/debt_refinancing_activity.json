    "combined_text": "an increase in cash received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees. Cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $22.8 billion to $46.8 billion, mainly due to a $24.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies,\n\nnet of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets, offset in part by a $1.9 billion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Cash from operations increased $3.7 billion to $33.3 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to lower operating expenditures and a reduction in materials and production costs, offset in part by a decrease in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $1.3 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $4.6 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of\n\nrepayments, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $949 million to $24.0 billion, mainly due to a $2.4 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $2.3 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets. Debt We issued debt to take advantage of favorable\n\npricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 was comprised mainly of unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs\n\nrepresents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017 also included payments for: Windows 10 licenses; post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Office 365 subscriptions; LinkedIn; Xbox Live subscriptions; Dynamics business solutions products; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software,\n\napplicable. Share Repurchases During fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased 170 million shares, 294 million shares, and 295 million shares of our common stock for $10.3 billion, $14.8 billion, and $13.2 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. See Note 18 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends See Note 18 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications\n\nof varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. Contractual\n\nObligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017: (In millions) 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 1,050 $ 9,518 $ 11,746 $ 55,523 $ 77,837 Interest payments 2,402 4,672 4,301 33,179 44,554 Construction commitments (b) 1,067 0 0 0 1,067 Operating leases (b) 1,292 2,335 1,657 2,588 7,872 Capital leases, including imputed interest (b) 334 835 866 4,612 6,647 Purchase commitments (c) 16,002 628 176 397 17,203 Other long-term liabilities (d) 0 120 26 319 465 Total contractual obligations $ 22,147 $\n\n18,108 $ 18,772 $ 96,618 $ 155,645 (a) See Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (b) See Note 16 – Commitments of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (c) Amounts represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (d) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, deferred income taxes, and long-term pension liabilities of $14.4 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We\n\nhave also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. 42 PART II Item 7 Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and\n\nliquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Of the cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 30, 2017, $127.9 billion was held by\n\nour foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects. The amount of cash, cash equivalents, and short- term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds (primarily currency and other local regulatory) was $2.4 billion. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 87% of the cash equivalents and short- term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in U.S. government and agency securities, approximately 3% were invested in U.S. mortgage- and asset-backed securities, and approximately 2% were invested in corporate notes and bonds of U.S. companies, all of which are\n\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were primarily invested in foreign securities. Securities lending We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Our securities lending payable balance was $97 million as of June\n\n30, 2017. Our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for fiscal year 2017 were $484 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. Intra-year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, domestic and international equities, and exchange-traded mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nare not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as foreign government bonds, corporate notes and bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, U.S. government and agency securities, common and preferred stock, and certificates of deposit. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, equity prices, and commodity prices. A portion of these risks is hedged, but they may impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged\n\ninclude the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities, consisting primarily of investment-grade securities. The credit risk and average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed-income indices. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. Equity Our equity portfolio consists of global, developed, and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk. We manage the securities relative to certain\n\nglobal and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. Commodity We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification. Our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities, including precious metals, energy, and grain. We manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices. VALUE-AT-RISK We use a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR is the expected loss, for a given confidence level, in the fair value of our portfolio due to\n\nadverse market movements over a defined time horizon. The VaR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than-temporary losses in fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices, assuming normal market conditions. The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level\n\nItem 7A.

The VaR is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the 97.5 percentile confidence level\n\nor, alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR in 25 out of 1,000 cases. Several risk factors are not captured in the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. 47 PART II Item 7A The following table sets forth the one-day VaR for substantially all of our positions as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 and for the year ended June 30, 2017: (In millions) June 30, June 30, Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2017 Risk Categories Average High Low Foreign currency $ 114 $ 92 $ 169 $ 303 $ 88 Interest rate 152 58\n\n113 155 57 Equity 54 157 121 165 54 Commodity 0 12 8 12 0 Total one-day VaR for the combined risk categories was $207 million and $225 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016. The total VaR is 35% and 29% less as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, than the sum of the separate risk categories in the table above due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks. 48\n\nintegration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data. We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. 75 PART II Item 8 The components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as follows: Weighted Weighted (In millions) Amount Average Life Amount Average Life Y ear Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Customer-related $ 3,607 7 years $ 30 3 years Technology-based 2,265 2 years 361 4 years Marketing-related 2,148\n\n19 years 2 1 year Contract-based 63 6 years 0 n/a Total $ 8,083 9 years $ 393 4 years Intangible assets amortization expense was $1.7 billion, $978 million, and $1.3 billion for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software was $55 million, $69 million, and $79 million for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of June 30, 2017: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2018 $ 2,190 2019 1,698 2020 1,180 2021 1,006 2022 932 Thereafter 3,100 Total $\n\n10,106 NOTE 12 — DEBT Short-term Debt As of June 30, 2017, we had $9.1 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.01% and maturities ranging from 25 days to 264 days. As of June 30, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.43% and maturities ranging from 1 day to 99 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value. We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on October 31, 2017 and November 14, 2018, respectively. These\n\ncredit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented. Long-term Debt As of June 30, 2017, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $77.1 billion and $80.3\n\nbillion, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $40.6 billion and $44.0 billion, respectively. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs. 76 PART II Item 8 The components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated interest rates were as follows: Stated Effective Interest Interest (In millions, except interest rates) Face Value Face Value Rate Rate June 30, 2017 2016 Notes November 15, 2017 $ 600 $ 600 0.875% 1.084% May 1, 2018 450 450 1.000% 1.106% November 3, 2018 1,750 1,750\n\nCurrent liabilities: Accounts payable $ 7,390 $ 6,898 Short-term debt 9,072 12,904 Current portion of long-term debt 1,049 0 Accrued compensation 5,819 5,264 Income taxes 718 580 Short-term unearned revenue 34,102 27,468 Securities lending payable 97 294 Other 6,280 5,949 Total current liabilities 64,527 59,357 Long-term debt 76,073 40,557 Long-term unearned revenue 10,377 6,441 Deferred income taxes 531 1,476 Other long-term liabilities 17,184 13,640 Total liabilities 168,692 121,471 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Common stock and paid-in capital – shares authorized 24,000;

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents. 65 PART II Item 8 Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize\n\nthe economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair"
