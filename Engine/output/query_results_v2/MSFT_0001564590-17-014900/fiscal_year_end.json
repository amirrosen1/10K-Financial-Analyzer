BUSINESS GENERAL Our vision Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence\n\n(“AI”). The way individuals and organizations use and interact with technology continues to evolve. A person’s experience with technology increasingly spans a multitude of devices and becomes more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions. We believe a new technology paradigm is emerging that manifests itself through an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge where computing is more distributed, AI drives insights and acts on the user’s behalf, and user experiences span devices with a user’s available data and information. We continue to transform our business to lead this new era of digital transformation and enable our customers\n\nagreement anniversary.

Partner Programs The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, hosting partner, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products\n\nand services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service\n\nproviders, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016, or 2015. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. 14 PART I Item 1 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Our executive officers as of August 2, 2017 were as follows: Name Age Position with the Company Satya Nadella 49 Chief Executive Officer Christopher C. Capossela 47 Executive Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Business, and Chief Marketing Officer Jean-Philippe Courtois 56 Executive Vice President and\n\nPresident, Microsoft Global Sales, Marketing and Operations Kathleen T. Hogan 51 Executive Vice President, Human Resources Amy E. Hood 45 Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Margaret L. Johnson 55 Executive Vice President, Business Development Bradford L. Smith 58 President and Chief Legal Officer Mr. Nadella was appointed Chief Executive Officer in February 2014. He served as Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise from July 2013 until that time. From 2011 to 2013, Mr. Nadella served as President, Server and Tools. From 2009 to 2011, he was Senior Vice President, Online Services Division. From 2008 to 2009, he was Senior\n\nVice President, Search, Portal, and Advertising. Since joining Microsoft in 1992, Mr. Nadella’s roles also included Vice President of the Business Division. Mr. Nadella also serves on the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation. Mr. Capossela was appointed Executive Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Business, and Chief Marketing Officer in July 2016. He had served as Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer since March 2014. Previously, he served as the worldwide leader of the Consumer Channels Group, responsible for sales and marketing activities with OEMs, operators, and retail partners. In his more than 25 years at Microsoft, Mr. Capossela has\n\ninterpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect\n\nour ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the\n\nultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination\n\nis made. 23 PART I Item 1A We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals from Congress to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows. Our\n\nhardware and software products may experience quality or supply problems. Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components\n\nour customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. Changes to trade policy or agreements may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Any of these changes may negatively\n\nimpact our revenues. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in\n\neconomic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner\n\nand retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks,\n\nwhich may be exacerbated by unusual events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results. Changes in our sales organization may impact revenues. In July 2017,\n\neconomic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue.

Changes in our sales organization may impact revenues. In July 2017,\n\nwe announced plans to reorganize our global sales organization to help enable customers’ digital transformation, add greater technical ability to our sales force, and create pooled resources that can be used across countries and industries. The reorganization is the most significant change in our global sales organization in Microsoft’s history, involving employees changing roles, adding additional talent, realigning teams, and onboarding new partners. Successfully executing these changes will be a significant factor in enabling future revenue growth. As we navigate through this transition, sales, profitability, and cash flow could be adversely impacted. 25\n\nfeet of owned space situated on approximately 500 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately five million square feet of space we lease.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2017 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 15 million square feet of space located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other general and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately 10 million square\n\nfeet of owned space situated on approximately 500 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately five million square feet of space we lease.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 26\n\noutstanding. Interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.6 billion, $1.1 billion, and $620 million, respectively. Effective July 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate unamortized discount and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were\n\n$715 million and $392 million, respectively. Maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2018 $ 1,050 2019 4,000 2020 5,518 2021 3,750 2022 7,996 Thereafter 55,523 Total $ 77,837 NOTE 13 — INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 2,739 $ 545 $ 3,661 U.S. state and local 30 136 364 Foreign 2,472 1,940 2,065 Current taxes 5,241 2,621 6,090 Def erred Taxes Deferred\n\ntaxes (3,296) 332 224 Provision for income taxes $ 1,945 $ 2,953 $ 6,314 78 PART II Item 8 In fiscal year 2017, deferred taxes included U.S. and foreign deferred tax benefit of $2.7 billion and $617 million, respectively. U.S. and foreign components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 U.S. $ 453 $ (325) $ 7,363 Foreign 22,696 20,076 11,144 Income before income taxes $ 23,149 $ 19,751 $ 18,507 In fiscal year 2017, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals\n\nrelated to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.4 billion and $317 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.0 billion and $588 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2015, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our phone business of $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were\n\nas follows: Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Federal statutory rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (15.7)% (19.4)% (20.9)% Phone business losses (7.3)% 1.3% 19.1% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation (2.7)% (2.0)% 0% Domestic production activities deduction (1.4)% (0.6)% (2.4)% Interest, net 1.8% 1.2% 1.5% Other reconciling items, net (1.3)% (0.5)% 1.8% Effective rate 8.4% 15.0% 34.1% The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers\n\nIf recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, by $10.2 billion, $8.8 billion, and $7.9 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $399 million, $163 million, and $237 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes. The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits\n\nwere as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Balance, beginning of year $ 10,164 $ 9,599 $ 8,714 Decreases related to settlements (4) (201) (50) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 1,277 1,086 1,091 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 397 115 94 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (49) (317) (144) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations (48) (118) (106) Balance, end of year $ 11,737 $ 10,164 $ 9,599 While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to\n\n2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2017, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on\n\nour consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of\n\nwhich are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 14 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES Phone Hardware Restructuring In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources (the “Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan”), under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of\n\n219 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (531) (1,476) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 1,881 $ (1,257) In fiscal year 2017, we corrected the table above to include a $2.5 billion loss carryforward and valuation allowance as of June 30, 2016. We do not consider this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. As of June 30, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $13.7 billion, including $11.1 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards\n\nand other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2017, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $142 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences\n\nwas approximately $45 billion as of June 30, 2017. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $2.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.4 billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. 80 PART II Item 8 Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in other long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits. Uncertain Tax Positions Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, were $11.7 billion, $10.2 billion, and $9.6 billion, respectively.\n\nIf recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, by $10.2 billion, $8.8 billion, and $7.9 billion, respectively.
