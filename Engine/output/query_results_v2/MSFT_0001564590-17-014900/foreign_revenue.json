Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.6 billion, $1.1 billion, and $620 million, respectively. Effective July 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate unamortized discount and debt issuance costs associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were\n\n$715 million and $392 million, respectively. Maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2018 $ 1,050 2019 4,000 2020 5,518 2021 3,750 2022 7,996 Thereafter 55,523 Total $ 77,837 NOTE 13 — INCOME TAXES The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 2,739 $ 545 $ 3,661 U.S. state and local 30 136 364 Foreign 2,472 1,940 2,065 Current taxes 5,241 2,621 6,090 Def erred Taxes Deferred\n\ntaxes (3,296) 332 224 Provision for income taxes $ 1,945 $ 2,953 $ 6,314 78 PART II Item 8 In fiscal year 2017, deferred taxes included U.S. and foreign deferred tax benefit of $2.7 billion and $617 million, respectively. U.S. and foreign components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 U.S. $ 453 $ (325) $ 7,363 Foreign 22,696 20,076 11,144 Income before income taxes $ 23,149 $ 19,751 $ 18,507 In fiscal year 2017, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign revenue deferrals\n\nrelated to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.4 billion and $317 million, respectively.

In fiscal year 2015, income before income taxes included the net impact of U.S. and foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our phone business of $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were\n\nas follows: Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Federal statutory rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (15.7)% (19.4)% (20.9)% Phone business losses (7.3)% 1.3% 19.1% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation (2.7)% (2.0)% 0% Domestic production activities deduction (1.4)% (0.6)% (2.4)% Interest, net 1.8% 1.2% 1.5% Other reconciling items, net (1.3)% (0.5)% 1.8% Effective rate 8.4% 15.0% 34.1% The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers\n\nassumptions include: the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation\n\nadjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer system integrators and developers. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox\n\nLive; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. 54 PART II Item 8 Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for\n\neach of the elements. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods of time, and when allowed under U.S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ESP”). For software elements,\n\nwe follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending"
