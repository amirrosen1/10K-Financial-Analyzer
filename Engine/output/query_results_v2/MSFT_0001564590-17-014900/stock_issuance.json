As of June 30, 2017, an aggregate of 127 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares\n\ngenerally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees. Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Stock-based compensation expense $ 3,266 $ 2,668 $ 2,574 Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation 1,066 882 868 88 PART II Item 8 Stock Plans Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Stock awards generally\n\nvest over a four or five-year service period. Executive Incentive Plan Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest ratably over a four-year service period. PSUs generally vest over a three-year performance period. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. Activity for all stock plans The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions: Year Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2015 Dividends per share\n\nand may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than\n\nthree months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term 57 PART II Item 8 based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt\n\nand publicly-traded equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or\n\nsecurity interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds\n\nits fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector\n\n1,478 1,478 0 0 Commercial paper 319 0 0 319 69 250 0 Certificates of deposit 1,358 0 0 1,358 972 386 0 U.S. government and agency securities 112,119 85 (360) 111,844 16 111,828 0 Foreign government bonds 5,276 2 (13) 5,265 1,504 3,761 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 3,921 14 (4) 3,931 0 3,931 0 Corporate notes and bonds 4,786 61 (12) 4,835 0 4,835 0 Municipal securities 284 43 0 327 0 327 0 Common and preferred stock 2,472 3,062 (34) 5,500 0 0 5,500 Other investments 523 0 0 523 0 0 523 Total $ 136,160 $\n\n3,267 $ (423) $139,004 $ 7,663 $ 125,318 $ 6,023 Cash Equity Unrealized Unrealized Recorded and Cash Short-term and Other (In millions) Cost Basis Gains Losses Basis Equivalents Investments Investments June 30, 2016 Cash $ 3,501 $ 0 $ 0 $ 3,501 $ 3,501 $ 0 $ 0 Mutual funds 1,012 0 0 1,012 1,012 0 0 Commercial paper 298 0 0 298 298 0 0 Certificates of deposit 1,000 0 0 1,000 868 132 0 U.S. government and agency securities 89,970 245 (11) 90,204 100 90,104 0 Foreign government bonds 5,502 10 (18) 5,494 731 4,763 0 Mortgage- and\n\nasset-backed securities 4,789 21 (2) 4,808 0 4,808 0 Corporate notes and bonds 6,509 110 (35) 6,584 0 6,584 0 Municipal securities 285 57 0 342 0 342 0 Common and preferred stock 5,597 4,452 (236) 9,813 0 0 9,813 Other investments 615 0 0 615 0 (3) 618 Total $ 119,078 $ 4,895 $ (302) $123,671 $ 6,510 $ 106,730 $ 10,431 As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $1.1 billion and $767 million, respectively.
