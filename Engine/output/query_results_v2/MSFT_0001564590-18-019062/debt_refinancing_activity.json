Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope\n\nand size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. Contractual Obligations The following\n\ntable summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2018: (In millions) 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 4,000 $ 9,268 $ 10,794 $ 52,836 $ 76,898 Interest payments 2,377 4,495 4,066 31,247 42,185 Construction commitments (b) 1,793 107 0 0 1,900 Operating leases, including imputed interest (c) 1,538 2,567 1,778 2,416 8,299 Finance leases, including imputed interest (c) 470 1,101 1,142 5,751 8,464 Transition tax (d) 1,495 2,808 2,808 10,530 17,641 Purchase commitments (e) 19,321 874 255 408 20,858 Other long-term liabilities (f) 0 76 19\n\n313 408 Total contractual obligations $ 30,994 $ 21,296 $ 20,862 $ 103,501 $ 176,653 (a) Refer to Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

(e) Amounts represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (f) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $13.6 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy.\n\nstock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased $40.7 billion to $6.1 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $19.1 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Fiscal Year 2017 Compared with Fiscal Year 2016 Cash from operations increased $6.2 billion to $39.5 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes,\n\noffset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees. Cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $22.8 billion to $46.8 billion, mainly due to a $24.6 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles and other assets, offset in part by a $1.9\n\nbillion decrease in cash used for net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Debt We issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 12 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned\n\nrevenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs and includes Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally billed upfront at the beginning of each annual coverage period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 44 PART II Item 7\n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2018: ( In millions) T hree Months Ending, September 30, 2018 $ 11,081 December 31, 2018 8,688 March 31, 2019 5,995 June 30, 2019 3,141 Thereafter 3,815 Total $ 32,720 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction- based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Share Repurchases For the fiscal years ended June\n\nItem 7 A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these\n\ninvestments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker- priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Cash from operations increased $4.4 billion to $43.9 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, mainly\n\ndue to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees, net cash paid for income taxes, cash paid for interest on debt, and cash paid to suppliers. Cash used in financing was $33.6 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, compared to cash from financing of $8.4 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The change was mainly due to a $41.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $1.1 billion decrease in cash used for common\n\nstock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased $40.7 billion to $6.1 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $19.1 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Fiscal Year 2017 Compared with Fiscal Year 2016 Cash from operations increased $6.2 billion to $39.5 billion during the fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers and an income tax refund for overpayment of estimated taxes,\n\noffset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees. Cash from financing increased $16.8 billion to $8.4 billion, mainly due to a $13.2 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, and a $4.2 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases, offset in part by an $839 million increase in dividends paid.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar,\n\nand Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Historically, we used a value-at-risk (“VaR”) model to estimate and quantify our market risks. This\n\nincluded presenting one-day VaR as well as average, high, and low VaR by risk category throughout the reporting period. Given the changes in size and allocation of our portfolio of financial assets, we believe sensitivity analysis is more informative in representing the potential impact to the portfolio as a result of market movements. Therefore, we have presented a sensitivity analysis for each risk category below. Sensitivity analysis is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value, including determinations of other-than- temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, but\n\nincluded presenting one-day VaR as well as average, high, and low VaR by risk category throughout the reporting period.

The estimated fair value of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.\n\nWe have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on October 30, 2018 and October 31, 2022, respectively. These credit facilities serve as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during any of the periods presented. Long-term Debt As of June 30, 2018, the total\n\ncarrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $76.2 billion and $77.5 billion, respectively.

Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $2.4\n\nbillion, $1.6 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $658 million and $715 million, respectively. Maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2019 $ 4,000 2020 5,518 2021 3,750 2022 8,044 2023 2,750 Thereafter 52,836 Total $ 76,898 NOTE 13 — INCOME TAXES Recent Tax Legislation On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changes existing U.S.\n\ntax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. The TCJA required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA also reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are measured in U.S. dollar equivalents. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency\n\nrisk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $6.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively.
