The impact in our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption will not be material.

NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common\n\nshares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI. Under the standard, equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are eligible for the measurement alternative. Using the measurement alternative, investments without readily determinable fair values will be valued at cost, with adjustments for changes in price or impairments reflected through net income. The standard will be\n\neffective for us beginning July 1, 2018. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment from AOCI to retained earnings as of the effective date. A cumulative-effect adjustment will capture any previously held unrealized gains and losses held in AOCI related to our equity investments carried at fair value as well as the impact of recording the fair value of certain equity investments carried at cost. In preparation for adoption of this standard, we have implemented internal controls to align with the new standard and have concluded that we will elect the\n\nmeasurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. The impact in our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption will not be material. Adoption of the standard will have no impact to cash from or used in operating, financing or investing in our consolidated cash flows statements.
