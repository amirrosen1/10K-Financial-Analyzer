    "combined_text": "PC market, primarily due to a higher mix of premium devices sold. • Search advertising revenue increased $791 million or 15%. Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, increased 9%, primarily driven by growth in Bing, due to higher revenue per search and search volume. • Gaming revenue decreased slightly, primarily due to lower Xbox hardware revenue, offset in part by higher revenue from Xbox software and services. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 21%, mainly due to lower prices of consoles sold and a decline in volume of consoles sold. Xbox software and services revenue increased 11%, driven by a higher\n\nvolume of Xbox Live transactions and revenue per transaction. • Surface revenue decreased $82 million or 2%, primarily due to a reduction in volumes sold, offset in part by a higher mix of premium devices. • Phone revenue decreased $2.8 billion. Operating income increased $2.6 billion or 43%, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 3%. • Operating expenses decreased $1.5 billion or 12%, driven by a reduction in Phone expenses and Surface launch-related expenses in the prior year. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $893 million or 16%, research and development expenses decreased $374 million or 6%, and general and\n\nadministrative expenses decreased $252 million or 16%. • Gross margin increased $1.1 billion or 6%, driven by growth in Windows, Search advertising, and Gaming, offset in part by a decline in Phone and Surface. Gross margin percentage increased, due to favorable sales mix and gross margin percent improvements across Windows, Gaming, and Search advertising, offset by a gross margin percent decline in Devices. Corporate and Other Corporate and Other operating loss is comprised of corporate-level activity not specifically allocated to a segment, including impairment and restructuring expenses. Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Corporate and Other operating loss\n\ndecreased $306 million, due to a reduction in impairment and restructuring expenses, driven by employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan in fiscal year 2017. 38 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2017 Compared with Fiscal Year 2016 Corporate and Other operating loss decreased $804 million, primarily due to a reduction in impairment and restructuring expenses, driven by asset impairment charges and restructuring charges related to our Phone business in fiscal year 2016, offset in part by employee severance expenses primarily related to our sales and marketing restructuring plan in fiscal year 2017. OPERATING EXPENSES\n\nResearch and Development Percentage Percentage Change 2018 Change 2017 (In millions, except percentages) 2018 2017 2016 Versus 2017 Versus 2016 Research and development $ 14,726 $ 13,037 $ 11,988 13% 9% As a percent of revenue 13% 13% 13% 0ppt 0ppt Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Research and\n\nimpacted reported revenue and reduced reported expenses from our international operations. This trend reversed in fiscal year 2018. Strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality We expect our revenue to fluctuate quarterly and to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending\n\nby consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in\n\nNote 21 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). 33 PART II Item 7 SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Percentage Percentage Change 2018 Change 2017 (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2018 2017 2016 Versus 2017 Versus 2016 Revenue $ 110,360 $ 96,571 $ 91,154 14% 6% Gross margin 72,007 62,310 58,374 16% 7% Operating income 35,058 29,025 26,078 21% 11% Net Income 16,571 25,489 20,539 (35)% 24% Diluted earnings per share 2.13 3.25 2.56 (34)% 27% Adjusted operating income 35,058 29,331 27,188 20% 8% Adjusted\n\nnet income 30,267 25,732 21,434 18% 20% Adjusted diluted earnings per share 3.88 3.29 2.67 18% 23% Consolidated results of operations include LinkedIn results since the date of acquisition on December 8, 2016. Fiscal year 2018 includes a full period of LinkedIn results, whereas fiscal year 2017 only includes results from the date of acquisition. Adjusted operating income, net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) exclude the net charge related to the TCJA, and impairment and restructuring expenses. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP\n\nto non-GAAP financial results. Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Revenue increased $13.8 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased, driven by LinkedIn and higher revenue from Office. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. More Personal Computing revenue increased, driven by higher revenue from Gaming, Windows, Search advertising, and Surface, offset in part by lower revenue from Phone. Gross margin increased $9.7 billion or 16%, due to growth across each of our segments. Gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven\n\nby a reduction in Phone cost of revenue. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $2.0 billion or 13%, primarily due to LinkedIn expenses and investments in commercial sales capacity, offset in part by a decrease in Windows marketing expenses. • Research and development expenses increased $1.7 billion or 13%, primarily due to investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn expenses. • General and administrative expenses increased $273 million or 6%, primarily due to LinkedIn expenses. Current year net income and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the net charge related to TCJA, which resulted in a decrease to net income and\n\ndiluted earnings per share of $13.7 billion and $1.75, respectively. Prior year diluted EPS was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, which resulted in a decrease in operating income, net income, and diluted EPS of $306 million, $243 million, and $0.04, respectively. 34 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2017 Compared with Fiscal Year 2016 Revenue increased $5.4 billion or 6%, driven by growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, offset in part by lower revenue from More Personal Computing. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased, driven by the acquisition of LinkedIn and higher revenue from Microsoft Office. Intelligent\n\nCloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services. More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from Devices, offset in part by higher revenue from Windows and Search advertising. Gross margin increased $3.9 billion or 7%, due to growth across each of our segments, including the acquisition of LinkedIn, driven by higher revenue. Gross margin percentage increased slightly due to a margin percent increase in More Personal Computing and segment sales mix, offset in part by margin percent declines in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud. Gross margin percentage includes a\n\n5 percentage point improvement in commercial cloud gross margin primarily across Azure and Office 365. Operating income increased $2.9 billion or 11%, primarily due to higher gross margin and lower impairment and restructuring expenses, offset in part by an increase in research and development and sales and marketing expenses. Operating income included an operating loss of $924 million related to the acquisition of LinkedIn, including $866 million of amortization of intangible assets. Operating income also included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 3%. Key changes in expenses were: • Cost of revenue increased $1.5 billion or 5%, mainly due to\n\ngrowth in our commercial cloud, the acquisition of LinkedIn, and higher Search advertising traffic acquisition costs, offset in part by a reduction in Phone sales and Gaming cost of revenue. • Research and development expenses increased $1.0 billion or 9%, primarily due to LinkedIn expenses and increased investments in cloud engineering, offset in part by a reduction in Phone expenses. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $826 million or 6%, primarily due to LinkedIn expenses and increased investments in sales capacity for our commercial cloud, offset in part by a reduction in Phone and marketing expenses. • Impairment and restructuring\n\nincluded presenting one-day VaR as well as average, high, and low VaR by risk category throughout the reporting period.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar,\n\nand Australian dollar.
