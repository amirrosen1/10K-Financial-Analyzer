BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world.\n\nOur platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We continue to transform our business to lead in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. In this next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual\n\noptional. In July 2014, we announced the retirement over a two-year period of Select Plus agreements for commercial organizations. Beginning July 2015, no new Select Plus agreements were signed with commercial organizations. 13 PART I Item 1 Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. Partner Programs The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services\n\nthey need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, hosting partner, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other\n\napplications and then license the unified business solution to their end users. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. 14 PART I Item 1 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Our executive officers as of August 3, 2018 were as follows: Name Age Position with the\n\nCompany Satya Nadella 50 Chief Executive Officer Christopher C. Capossela 48 Executive Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Business, and Chief Marketing Officer Jean-Philippe Courtois 57 Executive Vice President and President, Microsoft Global Sales, Marketing and Operations Kathleen T. Hogan 52 Executive Vice President, Human Resources Amy E. Hood 46 Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Margaret L. Johnson 56 Executive Vice President, Business Development Bradford L. Smith 59 President and Chief Legal Officer Mr. Nadella was appointed Chief Executive Officer in February 2014. He served as Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise from July 2013 until that time. From 2011\n\nto 2013, Mr. Nadella served as President, Server and Tools. From 2009 to 2011, he was Senior Vice President, Online Services Division. From 2008 to 2009, he was Senior Vice President, Search, Portal, and Advertising. Since joining Microsoft in 1992, Mr. Nadella’s roles also included Vice President of the Business Division. Mr. Nadella also serves on the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation. Mr. Capossela was appointed Executive Vice President, Marketing and Consumer Business, and Chief Marketing Officer in July 2016. He had served as Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer since March 2014. Previously, he served as the worldwide\n\nare less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in\n\nadverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated\n\nfinancial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates\n\nin our financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to TCJA, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where\n\nwe are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect in our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates\n\nputs a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. 26 PART I Item 1A Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies,\n\naccess to global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs\n\nof powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling,\n\nand other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances\n\nfor doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine\n\nadverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated\n\nfinancial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.

In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows. 25 PART I Item 1A We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant\n\n10 million square feet of owned space situated on approximately 540 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately five million square feet of space we lease. In addition, we own and lease space domestically that includes office, datacenter, and retail space. We also own and lease facilities internationally.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2018 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 15 million square feet of space located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other general and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately\n\n10 million square feet of owned space situated on approximately 540 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately five million square feet of space we lease.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 29\n\nissued by the U.S. Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), FASB, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which is not expected to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. The impacts of our estimates are described further below. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded an estimated net charge of $13.7 billion related to the TCJA, due to the impact of\n\nthe one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities. We recorded an estimated $17.9 billion charge in fiscal year 2018 related to the transition tax, which was included in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements and income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. We have not yet completed our accounting for the transition tax as our analysis of deferred foreign income is not complete. To calculate the transition\n\ntax, we estimated our deferred foreign income for fiscal year 2018 because these tax returns are not complete or due. Fiscal year 2018 taxable income will be known once the respective tax returns are completed and filed. In addition, U.S. and foreign audit settlements may significantly impact the estimated transition tax. The impact of the U.S. and foreign audits on the transition tax will be known as the audits are concluded. 81 PART II Item 8 In addition, we recorded an estimated $4.2 billion benefit in fiscal year 2018 from the impact of changes in the tax rate, primarily on\n\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, which was included in provision for income taxes in our consolidated income statements and deferred income taxes and long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. We remeasured our deferred taxes to reflect the reduced rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods. The TCJA subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. Due to the complexity of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of GAAP. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election\n\nto either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, and the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the table of deferred income tax assets and liabilities below. On August 1, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service published on its website proposed regulations relating to the transition tax imposed by the TCJA. Once published in the Federal Register, the proposed regulations are subject to a 60-day comment period. Final regulations are expected to be issued after consideration of comments.\n\ndue to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. 83 PART II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June\n\n30, 2018 2017 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 460 $ 777 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 1,832 1,859 Loss and credit carryforwards 3,369 4,809 Depreciation and amortization 351 53 Other 56 255 Deferred income tax assets 6,068 7,753 Less valuation allowance (3,186) (3,310) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 2,882 $ 4,443 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Foreign earnings $ 0 $ (1,134) Unrealized gain on investments and debt 0 (1,384) Unearned revenue (639) (5,760) Depreciation and amortization (1,103) (1,630) Other (312) (21) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (2,054) $ (9,929) Net deferred income tax\n\nassets (liabilities) $ 828 $ (5,486) Reported As Other long-term assets $ 1,369 $ 248 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (541) (5,734) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 828 $ (5,486) We recorded a deferred tax liability of $7.4 billion related to the recognition of revenue as part of the adoption of the new revenue standard. As of June 30, 2018, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $257 million, $1.4 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2019 through 2038, if\n\nnot utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to\n\nbe in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $5.5 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3.9 billion in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Uncertain Tax Positions Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were $12.0 billion, $11.7 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively, and were included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, by $11.3 billion, $10.2 billion, and $8.8 billion, respectively. 84 PART II Item 8 As\n\nassets (liabilities) $ 828 $ (5,486) Reported As Other long-term assets $ 1,369 $ 248 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (541) (5,734) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 828 $ (5,486) We recorded a deferred tax liability of $7.4 billion related to the recognition of revenue as part of the adoption of the new revenue standard. As of June 30, 2018, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $257 million, $1.4 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were $12.0 billion, $11.7 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively, and were included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, by $11.3 billion, $10.2 billion, and $8.8 billion, respectively. 84 PART II Item 8 As\n\nof June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $3.0 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits, net of tax effects, was $688 million, $399 million, and $163 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and was included in provision for income taxes. The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2018 2017 2016 Balance, beginning of year $ 11,737 $ 10,164 $ 9,599 Decreases related to\n\nsettlements (193) (4) (201) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 1,445 1,277 1,086 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 151 397 115 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (1,176) (49) (317) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations (3) (48) (118) Balance, end of year $ 11,961 $ 11,737 $ 10,164 While we settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal"
