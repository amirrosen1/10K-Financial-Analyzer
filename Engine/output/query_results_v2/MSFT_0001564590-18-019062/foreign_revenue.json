Investments for which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance\n\nobligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes\n\nmay differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices,\n\nand related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 56 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of\n\nproducts and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises\n\n4,412 $ 5,100 U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2018 2017 2016 U.S. $ 11,527 $ 6,843 $ 5,125 Foreign 24,947 23,058 20,514 Income before income taxes $ 36,474 $ 29,901 $ 25,639 82 PART II Item 8 Effective Tax Rate The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2018 2017 2016 Federal statutory rate 28.1% 35.0% 35.0% Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (7.8)% (11.6)% (14.5)%\n\nImpacts of TCJA 37.7% 0% 0% Phone business losses 0% (5.7)% 1.0% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation (2.5)% (2.1)% (1.6)% Interest, net 1.2% 1.4% 0.9% Other reconciling items, net (2.1)% (2.2)% (0.9)% Effective rate 54.6% 14.8% 19.9% The increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 is primarily due\n\nto earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 87%, 76%, and 91% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits, U.S. state income taxes, and domestic production activities deduction. In fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily\n\ndue to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries. 83 PART II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June\n\n30, 2018 2017 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 460 $ 777 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 1,832 1,859 Loss and credit carryforwards 3,369 4,809 Depreciation and amortization 351 53 Other 56 255 Deferred income tax assets 6,068 7,753 Less valuation allowance (3,186) (3,310) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 2,882 $ 4,443 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Foreign earnings $ 0 $ (1,134) Unrealized gain on investments and debt 0 (1,384) Unearned revenue (639) (5,760) Depreciation and amortization (1,103) (1,630) Other (312) (21) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (2,054) $ (9,929) Net deferred income tax\n\ninformation technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support.

These amounts are primarily included in Office products and services and server products and cloud services in the table above.
