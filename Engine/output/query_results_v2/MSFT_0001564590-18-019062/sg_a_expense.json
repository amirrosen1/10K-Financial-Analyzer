However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of\n\nthe underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines;\n\ninformation technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including impairment and restructuring expenses. Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2018 2017 2016 Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 35,865 $ 29,870 $ 25,792 Intelligent Cloud 32,219 27,407 24,952 More Personal Computing 42,276 39,294 40,410 Total $ 110,360 $ 96,571 $ 91,154 Operating Income\n\n(Loss) Productivity and Business Processes $ 12,924 $ 11,389 $ 11,756 Intelligent Cloud 11,524 9,127 9,249 More Personal Computing 10,610 8,815 6,183 Corporate and Other 0 (306) (1,110) Total $ 35,058 $ 29,025 $ 26,078 Corporate and Other operating loss comprised impairment and restructuring expenses.

We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax\n\nauthorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
