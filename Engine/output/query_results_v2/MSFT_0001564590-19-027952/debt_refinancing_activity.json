Cash used in investing increased $9.7 billion to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to a $6.0 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and\n\npurchases of intangible and other assets. 43 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Cash from operations increased $4.4 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2018, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees, net cash paid for income taxes, cash paid for interest on debt, and cash paid to suppliers. Cash used in financing was $33.6 billion for fiscal year 2018, compared to cash from financing of $8.4 billion for fiscal year 2017. The change was mainly due to a\n\n$41.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.1 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased $40.7 billion to $6.1 billion for fiscal year 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $19.1 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Debt We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our\n\ncredit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each\n\ncontract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2019: ( In millions) T hree Months Ending, September 30, 2019 $ 12,353 December 31, 2019 9,807 March 31, 2020\n\nwhere SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\n\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. 46 PART II Item 7 Impairment of\n\nInvestment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will\n\nbe required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a\n\nqualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using\n\nVersus 2018 Versus 2017 Operating income $ 42,959 $ 35,058 $ 29,025 23% 21% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties 0 0 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 0 0 0 * * Restructuring expenses 0 0 306 * * Non-GAAP operating income $ 42,959 $ 35,058 $ 29,331 23% 20% Net income $ 39,240 $ 16,571 $ 25,489 137% (35)% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties (2,567) 0 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 157 13,696 0 * * Restructuring expenses 0 0 243 * * Non-GAAP net income\n\n$ 36,830 $ 30,267 $ 25,732 22% 18% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.06 $ 2.13 $ 3.25 138% (34)% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties (0.33) 0 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 0.02 1.75 0 * * Restructuring expenses 0 0 0.04 * * Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 4.75 $ 3.88 $ 3.29 22% 18% * Not meaningful. 42 PART II Item 7 FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.8 billion as of both June 30, 2019 and 2018. Equity investments were $2.6\n\nbillion and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that\n\nthe short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or\n\nindirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar,\n\nand Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets\n\nare reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond\n\none year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. 60 PART II Item 8 Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in OCI. Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on\n\na quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook\n\nfor the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than- temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on\n\nJune 1, 2039 750 750 5.200% 5.240% October 1, 2040 1,000 1,000 4.500% 4.567% February 8, 2041 1,000 1,000 5.300% 5.361% November 15, 2042 900 900 3.500% 3.571% May 1, 2043 500 500 3.750% 3.829% December 15, 2043 500 500 4.875% 4.918% February 12, 2045 1,750 1,750 3.750% 3.800% November 3, 2045 3,000 3,000 4.450% 4.492% August 8, 2046 4,500 4,500 3.700% 3.743% February 6, 2047 3,000 3,000 4.250% 4.287% February 12, 2055 2,250 2,250 4.000% 4.063% November 3, 2055 1,000 1,000 4.750% 4.782% August 8, 2056 2,250 2,250 3.950% 4.033% February 6, 2057 2,000 2,000 4.500% 4.528% Total $\n\n72,781 $ 76,898 (a) Euro-denominated debt securities. The notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. Interest on these notes is paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $2.4 billion, $2.4 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate debt issuance costs and unamortized discount associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were $603 million and $658 million, respectively.\n\n77 PART II Item 8 Maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2020 $ 5,518 2021 3,750 2022 7,994 2023 2,750 2024 5,250 Thereafter 47,519 Total $ 72,781 NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the\n\nU.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. In fiscal year 2018, the TCJA required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In addition, the TCJA subjected us to a tax on our GILTI effective July 1, 2018. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat\n\ntaxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax\n\nLong-term income taxes 29,612 30,265 Long-term unearned revenue 4,530 3,815 Deferred income taxes 233 541 Operating lease liabilities 6,188 5,568 Other long-term liabilities 7,581 5,211 Total liabilities 184,226 176,130 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Common stock and paid-in capital – shares authorized 24,000; outstanding 7,643 and 7,677 78,520 71,223 Retained earnings 24,150 13,682 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (340) (2,187) Total stockholders’ equity 102,330 82,718 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $286,556 $258,848 Refer to accompanying notes. 53 PART II Item 8 CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Operations Net income $ 39,240 $ 16,571 $\n\n25,489 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash from operations: Depreciation, amortization, and other 11,682 10,261 8,778 Stock-based compensation expense 4,652 3,940 3,266 Net recognized gains on investments and derivatives (792) (2,212) (2,073) Deferred income taxes (6,463) (5,143) (829) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (2,812) (3,862) (1,216) Inventories 597 (465) 50 Other current assets (1,718) (952) 1,028 Other long-term assets (1,834) (285) (917) Accounts payable 232 1,148 81 Unearned revenue 4,462 5,922 3,820 Income taxes 2,929 18,183 1,792 Other current liabilities 1,419 798 356 Other long-term liabilities 591 (20) (118) Net cash from operations 52,185 43,884\n\n39,507 Financing Repayments of short-term debt, maturities of 90 days or less, net 0 (7,324) (4,963) Proceeds from issuance of debt 0 7,183 44,344 Repayments of debt (4,000) (10,060) (7,922) Common stock issued 1,142 1,002 772 Common stock repurchased (19,543) (10,721) (11,788) Common stock cash dividends paid (13,811) (12,699) (11,845) Other, net (675) (971) (190) Net cash from (used in) financing (36,887) (33,590) 8,408 Investing Additions to property and equipment (13,925) (11,632) (8,129) Acquisition of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets (2,388) (888) (25,944) Purchases of investments (57,697) (137,380) (176,905) Maturities of investments 20,043\n\n26,360 28,044 Sales of investments 38,194 117,577 136,350 Securities lending payable 0 (98) (197) Net cash used in investing (15,773) (6,061) (46,781) Effect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (115) 50 19 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (590) 4,283 1,153 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 11,946 7,663 6,510 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 11,356 $ 11,946 $ 7,663 Refer to accompanying notes. 54 PART II Item 8 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Common stock and paid-in capital Balance, beginning of period $ 71,223\n\n$ 69,315 $ 68,178 Common stock issued 6,829 1,002 772 Common stock repurchased (4,195) (3,033) (2,987) Stock-based compensation expense 4,652 3,940 3,266 Other, net 11 (1) 86 Balance, end of period 78,520 71,223 69,315 Retained earnings Balance, beginning of period 13,682 17,769 13,118 Net income 39,240 16,571 25,489 Common stock cash dividends (14,103) (12,917) (12,040) Common stock repurchased (15,346) (7,699) (8,798) Cumulative effect of accounting changes 677 (42) 0 Balance, end of period 24,150 13,682 17,769 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) Balance, beginning of period (2,187) 627 1,794 Other comprehensive income (loss) 1,914 (2,856) (1,167) Cumulative effect of accounting changes"
