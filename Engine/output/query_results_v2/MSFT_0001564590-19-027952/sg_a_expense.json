We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. We expect the IRS to begin an examination of tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved.\n\nWe believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax\n\nauthorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 13 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES In June 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. In fiscal year 2017, we recorded employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. The actions associated with this restructuring plan were completed as of June 30, 2018. 81 PART II Item 8 NOTE 14 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: ( In millions) June 30, 2019 2018 Productivity and Business Processes $ 16,831\n\n$ 14,864 Intelligent Cloud 16,988 14,706 More Personal Computing 3,387 3,150 Total $ 37,206 $ 32,720 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 Balance, beginning of period $ 32,720 Deferral of revenue 69,493 Recognition of unearned revenue (65,007) Balance, end of period $ 37,206 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized (“contracted not recognized revenue”), which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion as of June 30, 2019, of\n\nwhich we expect to recognize approximately 50% of the revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. Many customers are committing to our products and services for longer contract terms, which is increasing the percentage of contracted revenue that will be recognized beyond the next 12 months. NOTE 15 — LEASES We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some\n\nThings (“IoT”); and MSN advertising. • Devices, including Microsoft Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices. • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services, comprising Xbox Live transactions, subscriptions, cloud services, and advertising (“Xbox Live”), video games, and third-party video game royalties. • Search. 89 PART II Item 8 Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying\n\nproducts and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology;\n\nhuman resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including restructuring expenses. Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 41,160 $ 35,865 $ 29,870 Intelligent Cloud 38,985 32,219 27,407 More Personal Computing 45,698 42,276 39,294 Total $ 125,843 $ 110,360 $ 96,571 Operating Income (Loss) Productivity and Business\n\nProcesses $ 16,219 $ 12,924 $ 11,389 Intelligent Cloud 13,920 11,524 9,127 More Personal Computing 12,820 10,610 8,815 Corporate and Other 0 0 (306) Total $ 42,959 $ 35,058 $ 29,025 Corporate and Other operating loss comprised restructuring expenses. No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2019, 2018, or 2017. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers were located, was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 United States (a) $ 64,199 $ 55,926 $ 51,078\n\nOther countries 61,644 54,434 45,493 Total $ 125,843 $ 110,360 $ 96,571 (a) Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue. 90 PART II Item 8 Revenue from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as follows: ( In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Server products and cloud services $ 32,622 $ 26,129 $ 21,649 Office products and cloud services 31,769 28,316 25,573 Windows 20,395 19,518 18,593 Gaming 11,386 10,353 9,051 Search advertising 7,628 7,012 6,219\n\nOur foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 82%, 87%, and 76% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits, GILTI, and U.S. state income taxes. In fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA\n\nin the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2019 2018 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation\n\nexpense $ 406 $ 460 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 2,287 1,832 Loss and credit carryforwards 3,518 3,369 Depreciation and amortization 7,046 351 Leasing liabilities 1,594 1,427 Unearned revenue 475 0 Other 367 56 Deferred income tax assets 15,693 7,495 Less valuation allowance (3,214) (3,186) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 12,479 $ 4,309 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Unrealized gain on investments and debt $ (738) $ 0 Unearned revenue (30) (639) Depreciation and amortization 0 (1,164) Leasing assets (1,510) (1,366) Deferred GILTI tax liabilities (2,607) (61) Other (291) (251) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (5,176) $\n\n(3,481) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 7,303 $ 828 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 7,536 $ 1,369 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (233) (541) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 7,303 $ 828 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. 80 PART II Item 8 As of June 30, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $978\n\nmillion, $770 million, and $11.6 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2020 through 2039, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance.
