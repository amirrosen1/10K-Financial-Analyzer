NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 67 PART II Item 8 The components of basic and diluted EPS were\n\nas follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 44,281 $ 39,240 $ 16,571 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,610 7,673 7,700 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 73 80 94 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,683 7,753 7,794 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 5.82 $ 5.11 $ 2.15 Diluted (A/C) $ 5.76 $ 5.06 $ 2.13 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented. NOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The\n\ncomponents of other income (expense), net were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Interest and dividends income $ 2,680 $ 2,762 $ 2,214 Interest expense (2,591) (2,686) (2,733) Net recognized gains on investments 32 648 2,399 Net gains (losses) on derivatives 187 144 (187) Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements (191) (82) (218) Other, net (40) (57) (59) Total $ 77 $ 729 $ 1,416 Net Recognized Gains (Losses) on Investments Net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Realized gains from sales of\n\navailable-for-sale securities $ 50 $ 12 $ 27 Realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (37) (93) (987) Other-than-temporary impairments of investments (17) (16) (6) Total $ (4) $ (97) $ (966) Net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Net realized gains on investments sold $ 83 $ 276 $ 3,406 Net unrealized gains on investments still held 69 479 0 Impairments of investments (116) (10) (41) Total $ 36 $ 745 $ 3,365 68 PART II Item 8 NOTE 4 — INVESTMENTS Investment Components The components of\n\ninvestments were as follows: Cash Fair Value Unrealized Unrealized Recorded and Cash Short-term Equity (In millions) Level Cost Basis Gains Losses Basis Equivalents Investments Investments June 30, 2020 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 4,687 $ 1 $ 0 $ 4,688 $ 1,618 $ 3,070 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,898 0 0 2,898 1,646 1,252 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 92,067 6,495 (1) 98,561 3,168 95,393 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 2,439 2 0 2,441 449 1,992 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 6,982 6 (3) 6,985\n\nrelated to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. In April 2020, the IRS commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017. As of June 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material\n\nimpact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to\n\n2019, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 13 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: ( In millions) June 30, 2020 2019 Productivity and Business Processes $ 18,643 $ 16,831 Intelligent Cloud 16,620 16,988 More Personal Computing 3,917 3,387 Total $ 39,180 $ 37,206 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Y ear Ended June 30, 2020 Balance, beginning of period $ 37,206 Deferral of revenue 78,922 Recognition of unearned revenue\n\n(76,948) Balance, end of period $ 39,180 82 PART II Item 8 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $111 billion as of June 30, 2020, of which $107 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. NOTE 14 — LEASES We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining\n\nlease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. The components of lease expense were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Operating lease cost $ 2,043 $ 1,707 $ 1,585 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 611 $ 370 $ 243 Interest on lease liabilities 336 247 175 Total finance lease cost $ 947 $ 617 $ 418 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as\n\nbillion, $38.1 billion and $26.6 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These amounts are primarily included in Office products and cloud services, Server products and cloud services, and LinkedIn in the table above. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets,\n\nclassified by the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2020 2019 2018 United States $ 60,789 $ 55,252 $ 44,501 Ireland 12,734 12,958 12,843 Other countries 29,770 25,422 22,538 Total $ 103,293 $ 93,632 $ 79,882 92 PART II Item 8 NOTE 20 — QUARTERLY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (In millions, except per share amounts) Quarter Ended September 30 December 31 March 31 June 30 Total Fiscal Year 2020 Revenue $ 33,055 $ 36,906 $ 35,021 $ 38,033 $ 143,015 Gross margin 22,649 24,548 24,046\n\n25,694 96,937 Operating income 12,686 13,891 12,975 13,407 52,959 Net income 10,678 11,649 10,752 11,202 44,281 Basic earnings per share 1.40 1.53 1.41 1.48 5.82 Diluted earnings per share 1.38 1.51 1.40 1.46 5.76 Fiscal Year 2019 Revenue 29,084 32,471 30,571 33,717 125,843 Gross margin 19,179 20,048 20,401 23,305 82,933 Operating income 9,955 10,258 10,341 12,405 42,959 Net income (a) 8,824 8,420 8,809 13,187 39,240 Basic earnings per share 1.15 1.09 1.15 1.72 5.11 Diluted earnings per share (b) 1.14 1.08 1.14 1.71 5.06 (a) Reflects the $157 million net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA for the\n\nsecond quarter and the $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to the intangible property transfers for the fourth quarter, which together increased net income by $2.4 billion for fiscal year 2019.
