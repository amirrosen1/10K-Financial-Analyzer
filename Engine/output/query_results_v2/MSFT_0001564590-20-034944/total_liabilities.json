The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’\n\ngeneral causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal\n\nyear 2021. 85 PART II Item 8 Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2020, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $306 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes\n\nthat we estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Foreign currency risks related to\n\ncertain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro- denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. In the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged included the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in\n\n35,058 Other income, net 77 729 1,416 Income before income taxes 53,036 43,688 36,474 Provision for income taxes 8,755 4,448 19,903 Net income $ 44,281 $ 39,240 $ 16,571 Earnings per share: Basic $ 5.82 $ 5.11 $ 2.15 Diluted $ 5.76 $ 5.06 $ 2.13 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 7,610 7,673 7,700 Diluted 7,683 7,753 7,794 Refer to accompanying notes. 55 PART II Item 8 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Net income $ 44,281 $ 39,240 $ 16,571 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax: Net change related to derivatives (38)\n\n(173) 39 Net change related to investments 3,990 2,405 (2,717) Translation adjustments and other (426) (318) (178) Other comprehensive income (loss) 3,526 1,914 (2,856) Comprehensive income $ 47,807 $ 41,154 $ 13,715 Refer to accompanying notes. 56 PART II Item 8 BALANCE SHEETS (In millions) June 30, 2020 2019 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,576 $ 11,356 Short-term investments 122,951 122,463 Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 136,527 133,819 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $788 and $411 32,011 29,524 Inventories 1,895 2,063 Other current assets 11,482 10,146 Total current assets 181,915 175,552\n\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $43,197 and $35,330 44,151 36,477 Operating lease right-of-use assets 8,753 7,379 Equity investments 2,965 2,649 Goodwill 43,351 42,026 Intangible assets, net 7,038 7,750 Other long-term assets 13,138 14,723 Total assets $ 301,311 $ 286,556 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 12,530 $ 9,382 Current portion of long-term debt 3,749 5,516 Accrued compensation 7,874 6,830 Short-term income taxes 2,130 5,665 Short-term unearned revenue 36,000 32,676 Other current liabilities 10,027 9,351 Total current liabilities 72,310 69,420 Long-term debt 59,578 66,662 Long-term income taxes 29,432 29,612 Long-term unearned revenue 3,180 4,530 Deferred\n\nincome taxes 204 233 Operating lease liabilities 7,671 6,188 Other long-term liabilities 10,632 7,581 Total liabilities 183,007 184,226 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Common stock and paid-in capital – shares authorized 24,000; outstanding 7,571 and 7,643 80,552 78,520 Retained earnings 34,566 24,150 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 3,186 (340) Total stockholders’ equity 118,304 102,330 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 301,311 $ 286,556 Refer to accompanying notes. 57 PART II Item 8 CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Operations Net income $ 44,281 $ 39,240 $ 16,571 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net\n\ncash from operations: Depreciation, amortization, and other 12,796 11,682 10,261 Stock-based compensation expense 5,289 4,652 3,940 Net recognized gains on investments and derivatives (219) (792) (2,212) Deferred income taxes 11 (6,463) (5,143) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (2,577) (2,812) (3,862) Inventories 168 597 (465) Other current assets (2,330) (1,718) (952) Other long-term assets (1,037) (1,834) (285) Accounts payable 3,018 232 1,148 Unearned revenue 2,212 4,462 5,922 Income taxes (3,631) 2,929 18,183 Other current liabilities 1,346 1,419 798 Other long-term liabilities 1,348 591 (20) Net cash from operations 60,675 52,185 43,884 Financing Repayments of short-term debt, maturities of"
