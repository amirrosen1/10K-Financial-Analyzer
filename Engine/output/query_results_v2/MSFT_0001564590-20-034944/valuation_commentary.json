    "combined_text": "investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not\n\nreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology.\n\nThis analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred\n\ninternally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue\n\nover the estimated life of the products. 51 PART II Item 7 Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and\n\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are\n\nan immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because\n\nthe broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker- priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Cash from operations increased $8.5 billion to $60.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly\n\ndue to an increase in cash from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash used to pay income taxes, suppliers, and employees. Cash used in financing increased $9.1 billion to $46.0 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $3.4 billion cash premium on our debt exchange, a $3.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases, a $1.5 billion increase in repayments of debt, and a $1.3 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $3.6 billion to $12.2 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash from net investment\n\npurchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and $1.2 billion in other investing to facilitate the purchase of components. 47 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Cash from operations increased $8.3 billion to $52.2 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and an increase in cash paid for income taxes.

Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make\n\na reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.

(f) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $15.2 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing,\n\nproduct support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment.

Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For\n\nderivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs\n\nused in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: • Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. • Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for\n\nsimilar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of\n\ndeposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. 65 PART II Item 8 • Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and\n\n0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,018 0 0 2,018 1,430 588 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 104,925 1,854 (104) 106,675 769 105,906 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 988 0 0 988 698 290 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 6,350 4 (8) 6,346 2,506 3,840 0 Mortgage- and asset- backed securities Level 2 3,554 10 (3) 3,561 0 3,561 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 7,437 111 (7) 7,541 0 7,541 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 15 0 0 15 0 15 0 Municipal securities Level 2 242 48 0 290 0 290 0\n\nMunicipal securities Level 3 7 0 0 7 0 7 0 Total debt investments $ 127,747 $ 2,027 $ (122) $ 129,652 $ 7,176 $ 122,476 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Equity investments Level 1 $ 973 $ 409 $ 0 $ 564 Equity investments Other 2,085 0 0 2,085 Total equity investments $ 3,058 $ 409 $ 0 $ 2,649 Cash $ 3,771 $ 3,771 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) (13) 0 (13) 0 Total $ 136,468 $ 11,356 $ 122,463 $ 2,649 (a) Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further\n\ninformation on the fair value of our derivative instruments.
