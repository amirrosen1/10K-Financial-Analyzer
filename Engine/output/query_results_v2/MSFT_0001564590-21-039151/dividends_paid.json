Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of\n\nthe product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2021: ( In millions) T hree Months Ending September 30, 2021 $ 15,922 December 31, 2021 12,646 March 31, 2022 8,786 June 30, 2022 4,171 Thereafter 2,616 Total $ 44,141 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being\n\nrecognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Share Repurchases During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 101 million shares and 126 million shares of our common stock for $23.0 billion and $19.7 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item\n\n8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not\n\nhave a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. 50 PART II Item 7 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021: (In millions) 2022 2023-2024 2025-2026 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 8,075 $ 8,000 $ 5,250 $ 42,585 $ 63,910 Interest payments 1,628 2,847 2,438 17,320 24,233 Construction commitments (b) 8,927 529 0 0 9,456 Operating leases, including imputed interest (c) 2,801 4,956 3,469 6,747 17,973 Finance leases, including imputed interest (c) 1,341 3,256 3,774 14,096 22,467 Transition\n\nuse observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our\n\nfair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Cash from operations increased $16.1 billion to $76.7 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing increased $2.5 billion to $48.5 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to a $4.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases and\n\na $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $1.8 billion decrease in repayments of debt and a $1.7 billion decrease in cash premium paid on debt exchange. Cash used in investing increased $15.4 billion to $27.6 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, a $5.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $4.1 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Debt We issue debt to take\n\nadvantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In March 2021 and June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest\n\nrate environment. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 49 PART II Item 7 Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of\n\ndecrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the tax benefits related to the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in fiscal\n\nyear 2021. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: Percentage (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2021 2020 Change Net income $ 61,271 $\n\n44,281 38% Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes (620) 0 * Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 60,651 $ 44,281 37% Diluted earnings per share $ 8.05 $ 5.76 40% Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes (0.08) 0 * Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 7.97 $ 5.76 38% * Not meaningful. 48 PART II Item 7 FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $130.3 billion and $136.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. Equity investments were\n\n$6.0 billion and $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given\n\nthat the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly\n\nItem 7A.

RSUs generally vest ratably over a service period of four years. PSUs generally vest over a performance period of three years. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. Activity for All Stock Plans The fair\n\nvalue of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions: Year ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Dividends per share (quarterly amounts) $ 0.51–0.56 $ 0.46–0.51 $ 0.42–0.46 Interest rates 0.01%–1.5% 0.1%–2.2% 1.8%–3.1% During fiscal year 2021, the following activity occurred under our stock plans: Weighted Average Grant-Date Shares Fair Value (In millions) Stock Awards Nonvested balance, beginning of year 126 $ 105.23 Granted (a) 40 221.13 Vested (58) 99.41 Forfeited (8) 129.92 Nonvested balance, end of year 100 $ 152.51 (a) Includes 2 million of PSUs granted at target and performance adjustments above target\n\nlevels for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. As of June 30, 2021, there was approximately $12.0 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted was $221.13, $140.49, and $107.02 for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The fair value of stock awards vested was $13.4 billion, $10.1 billion, and $8.7 billion, for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
