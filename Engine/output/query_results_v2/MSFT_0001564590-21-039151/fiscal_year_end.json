BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world.\n\nOur platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. Our ecosystem of customers and partners has stepped up to help people and organizations in every country use technology to be resilient and transform during the most trying of circumstances. Amid rapid change we’ve witnessed technology empower telehealth, remote manufacturing, and new ways of working from home and serving customers. These capabilities have relied on\n\nmanagement. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: • Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another. • Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. • Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer’s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication. • Using Windows\n\nto fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more. • Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms. • Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment. Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product\n\ncategory definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft. COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices, and continues to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of\n\nthis Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2021 financial results. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment to Sustainability We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable\n\nsolutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world\n\napproval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. 31 PART I Item 1A We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future\n\nlegislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable,\n\ntax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our\n\noperating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying\n\nestimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding\n\napproval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. 31 PART I Item 1A We may have additional tax liabilities.

Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably\n\nestimable.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 36\n\nto uncertain tax positions of $274 million, $579 million, and $515 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 13,792 $ 13,146 $ 11,961 Decreases related to settlements (195) (31) (316) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 790 647 2,106 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 461 366 508 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (297) (331) (1,113) Decreases due to lapsed statutes\n\nof limitations (1) (5) 0 Ending unrecognized tax benefits $ 14,550 $ 13,792 $ 13,146 We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year\n\n2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. As of June 30, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer\n\npricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nNOTE 13 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: ( In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 Productivity and Business Processes $ 22,120 $ 18,643 Intelligent Cloud 17,710 16,620 More Personal Computing 4,311 3,917 Total $ 44,141 $ 39,180 85 PART II Item 8 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Y ear Ended June 30, 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 39,180 Deferral of revenue 94,565 Recognition of unearned revenue (89,604) Balance, end of period $ 44,141 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized\n\nprice were as follows: (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $ 234 Goodwill 5,497 Intangible assets 1,267 Other assets 143 Other liabilities (217) Total $ 6,924 The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Intelligent Cloud segment. Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: Weighted (In millions) Amount Average Life Customer-related $ 648 8 years Technology-based 447 5 years Marketing-related 170 10 years Contract-based 2 2\n\nyears Total $ 1,267 7 years Transactions recognized separately from the purchase price allocation were approximately $600 million, primarily related to equity awards recognized as expense over the related service period. Nuance Communications, Inc. On April 11, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”) for $56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of Nuance’s net debt. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The acquisition has been approved by Nuance’s\n\nshareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 78 PART II Item 8 NOTE 9 — GOODWILL Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: June 30, June 30, June 30, (In millions) 2019 Acquisitions Other 2020 Acquisitions Other 2021 Productivity and Business Processes $ 24,277 $ 7 $ (94) $ 24,190 $ 0 $ 127 $ 24,317 Intelligent Cloud 11,351 1,351 (5) 12,697 505 54 13,256 More Personal Computing 6,398 96 (30) 6,464 5,556(a) 118(a) 12,138 Total $\n\n42,026 $ 1,454 $ (129) $ 43,351 $ 6,061 $ 299 $ 49,711 (a) Includes goodwill of $5.5 billion related to ZeniMax. See Note 8 – Business Combinations for further information. The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from\n\nforeign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2021, May 1, 2020, or May\n\nin investments and debt $ (2,605) $ (2,642) Leasing assets (3,834) (2,817) Depreciation (1,010) (376) Deferred GILTI tax liabilities (2,815) (2,581) Other (144) (344) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (10,408) $ (8,760) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 7,181 $ 6,405 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (198) (204) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect\n\nwhen the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2021, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $304 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2022 through 2041, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above\n\nrelates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $13.4 billion, $12.5 billion, and $8.4 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 84 PART II Item 8 Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2021, 2020,\n\nand 2019, were $14.6 billion, $13.8 billion, and $13.1 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 by $12.5 billion, $12.1 billion, and $12.0 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $4.3 billion, $4.0 billion, and $3.4 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 included interest expense related\n\nto uncertain tax positions of $274 million, $579 million, and $515 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 13,792 $ 13,146 $ 11,961 Decreases related to settlements (195) (31) (316) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 790 647 2,106 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 461 366 508 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (297) (331) (1,113) Decreases due to lapsed statutes"
