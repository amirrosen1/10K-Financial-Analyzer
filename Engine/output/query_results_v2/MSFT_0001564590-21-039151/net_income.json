Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the\n\nrelative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and\n\nfines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments. Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 53,915 $ 46,398 $ 41,160 Intelligent Cloud 60,080 48,366 38,985 More Personal Computing 54,093 48,251 45,698 Total $ 168,088 $ 143,015 $ 125,843 Operating Income Productivity and Business Processes\n\n$ 24,351 $ 18,724 $ 16,219 Intelligent Cloud 26,126 18,324 13,920 More Personal Computing 19,439 15,911 12,820 Total $ 69,916 $ 52,959 $ 42,959 No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers were located, was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 United States (a) $ 83,953 $ 73,160 $ 64,199 Other countries 84,135 69,855 61,644 Total $ 168,088 $ 143,015 $ 125,843 (a) Includes billings\n\nto OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue. 94 PART II Item 8 Revenue from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as follows: ( In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Server products and cloud services $ 52,589 $ 41,379 $ 32,622 Office products and cloud services 39,872 35,316 31,769 Windows 23,227 22,294 20,395 Gaming 15,370 11,575 11,386 LinkedIn 10,289 8,077 6,754 Search advertising 8,528 7,740 7,628 Enterprise Services 6,943 6,409 6,124 Devices 6,791 6,457 6,095 Other 4,479\n\n2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. As of June 30, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer\n\npricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nNOTE 13 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: ( In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 Productivity and Business Processes $ 22,120 $ 18,643 Intelligent Cloud 17,710 16,620 More Personal Computing 4,311 3,917 Total $ 44,141 $ 39,180 85 PART II Item 8 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Y ear Ended June 30, 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 39,180 Deferral of revenue 94,565 Recognition of unearned revenue (89,604) Balance, end of period $ 44,141 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized\n\nas revenue in future periods, was $146 billion as of June 30, 2021, of which $141 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.
