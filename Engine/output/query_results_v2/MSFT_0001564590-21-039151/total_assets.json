The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit\n\nin the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 502 $ 461 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 2,960 2,721 Loss and credit carryforwards 1,090 865 Amortization 6,346 6,737 Leasing liabilities 4,060 3,025 Unearned revenue 2,659 1,553 Other 543 354 Deferred income tax assets 18,160 15,716 Less valuation allowance (769) (755) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 17,391 $ 14,961 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Book/tax basis differences\n\nin investments and debt $ (2,605) $ (2,642) Leasing assets (3,834) (2,817) Depreciation (1,010) (376) Deferred GILTI tax liabilities (2,815) (2,581) Other (144) (344) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (10,408) $ (8,760) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 7,181 $ 6,405 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (198) (204) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect\n\nwhen the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2021, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $304 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2022 through 2041, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above\n\nrelates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $13.4 billion, $12.5 billion, and $8.4 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 84 PART II Item 8 Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2021, 2020,\n\n42,959 Other income, net 1,186 77 729 Income before income taxes 71,102 53,036 43,688 Provision for income taxes 9,831 8,755 4,448 Net income $ 61,271 $ 44,281 $ 39,240 Earnings per share: Basic $ 8.12 $ 5.82 $ 5.11 Diluted $ 8.05 $ 5.76 $ 5.06 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 7,547 7,610 7,673 Diluted 7,608 7,683 7,753 Refer to accompanying notes. 57 PART II Item 8 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Net income $ 61,271 $ 44,281 $ 39,240 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax: Net change related to derivatives 19\n\n(38) (173) Net change related to investments (2,266) 3,990 2,405 Translation adjustments and other 873 (426) (318) Other comprehensive income (loss) (1,374) 3,526 1,914 Comprehensive income $ 59,897 $ 47,807 $ 41,154 Refer to accompanying notes. 58 PART II Item 8 BALANCE SHEETS (In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 14,224 $ 13,576 Short-term investments 116,110 122,951 Total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 130,334 136,527 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $751 and $788 38,043 32,011 Inventories 2,636 1,895 Other current assets 13,393 11,482 Total current assets 184,406 181,915\n\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $51,351 and $43,197 59,715 44,151 Operating lease right-of-use assets 11,088 8,753 Equity investments 5,984 2,965 Goodwill 49,711 43,351 Intangible assets, net 7,800 7,038 Other long-term assets 15,075 13,138 Total assets $ 333,779 $ 301,311 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 15,163 $ 12,530 Current portion of long-term debt 8,072 3,749 Accrued compensation 10,057 7,874 Short-term income taxes 2,174 2,130 Short-term unearned revenue 41,525 36,000 Other current liabilities 11,666 10,027 Total current liabilities 88,657 72,310 Long-term debt 50,074 59,578 Long-term income taxes 27,190 29,432 Long-term unearned revenue 2,616 3,180 Deferred\n\nincome taxes 198 204 Operating lease liabilities 9,629 7,671 Other long-term liabilities 13,427 10,632 Total liabilities 191,791 183,007 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Common stock and paid-in capital – shares authorized 24,000; outstanding 7,519 and 7,571 83,111 80,552 Retained earnings 57,055 34,566 Accumulated other comprehensive income 1,822 3,186 Total stockholders’ equity 141,988 118,304 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 333,779 $ 301,311 Refer to accompanying notes. 59 PART II Item 8 CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Operations Net income $ 61,271 $ 44,281 $ 39,240 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash\n\nfrom operations: Depreciation, amortization, and other 11,686 12,796 11,682 Stock-based compensation expense 6,118 5,289 4,652 Net recognized gains on investments and derivatives (1,249) (219) (792) Deferred income taxes (150) 11 (6,463) Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (6,481) (2,577) (2,812) Inventories (737) 168 597 Other current assets (932) (2,330) (1,718) Other long-term assets (3,459) (1,037) (1,834) Accounts payable 2,798 3,018 232 Unearned revenue 4,633 2,212 4,462 Income taxes (2,309) (3,631) 2,929 Other current liabilities 4,149 1,346 1,419 Other long-term liabilities 1,402 1,348 591 Net cash from operations 76,740 60,675 52,185 Financing Cash premium on debt exchange (1,754) (3,417)\n\nItem 8.
