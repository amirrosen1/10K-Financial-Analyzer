The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert\n\nscientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing on general causation is scheduled for January and February of 2022. 88 PART II Item 8 Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from\n\ntime to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2021, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $339 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists\n\nthe possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. NOTE 16 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Balance, beginning of year 7,571 7,643 7,677 Issued 49 54 116 Repurchased (101) (126) (150) Balance, end of year 7,519 7,571 7,643 Share Repurchases On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in December 2016 and\n\nwas completed in February 2020. On September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. This share repurchase program commenced in February 2020, following completion of the program approved on September 20, 2016, has no expiration date, and may be terminated at any time. As of June 30, 2021, $8.7 billion remained of this $40.0 billion share repurchase program. 89 PART II Item 8 We repurchased the following shares of common stock under the share repurchase programs: (In millions) Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount Year Ended June 30,\n\n2020, and 2019, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. 83 PART II Item 8 The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit\n\nin the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 502 $ 461 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 2,960 2,721 Loss and credit carryforwards 1,090 865 Amortization 6,346 6,737 Leasing liabilities 4,060 3,025 Unearned revenue 2,659 1,553 Other 543 354 Deferred income tax assets 18,160 15,716 Less valuation allowance (769) (755) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 17,391 $ 14,961 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Book/tax basis differences\n\nin investments and debt $ (2,605) $ (2,642) Leasing assets (3,834) (2,817) Depreciation (1,010) (376) Deferred GILTI tax liabilities (2,815) (2,581) Other (144) (344) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (10,408) $ (8,760) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 7,181 $ 6,405 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (198) (204) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect\n\nwhen the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2021, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $304 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2022 through 2041, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above\n\nrelates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $13.4 billion, $12.5 billion, and $8.4 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 84 PART II Item 8 Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2021, 2020,\n\nas follows: Maturities Stated Interest Effective Interest June 30, June 30, (In millions, issuance by calendar year) (calendar year) Rate Rate 2021 2020 2009 issuance of $3.8 billion (a) 2039 5.20% 5.24% $ 520 $ 559 2010 issuance of $4.8 billion (a) 2040 4.50% 4.57% 486 1,571 2011 issuance of $2.3 billion (a) 2041 5.30% 5.36% 718 1,270 2012 issuance of $2.3 billion (a) 2022–2042 2.13%–3.50% 2.24%–3.57% 1,204 1,650 2013 issuance of $5.2 billion (a) 2023–2043 2.38%–4.88% 2.47%–4.92% 2,814 2,919 2013 issuance of €4.1 billion 2021–2033 2.13%–3.13% 2.23%–3.22% 4,803 4,549 2015 issuance of $23.8 billion (a) 2022–2055 2.38%–4.75% 2.47%–4.78% 12,305\n\n15,549 2016 issuance of $19.8 billion (a) 2021–2056 1.55%–3.95% 1.64%–4.03% 12,180 16,955 2017 issuance of $17.0 billion (a) 2022–2057 2.40%–4.50% 2.52%–4.53% 10,695 12,385 2020 issuance of $10.0 billion (a) 2050–2060 2.53%–2.68% 2.53%–2.68% 10,000 10,000 2021 issuance of $8.2 billion (a) 2052–2062 2.92%–3.04% 2.92%–3.04% 8,185 0 Total face value 63,910 67,407 Unamortized discount and issuance costs (511) (554) Hedge fair value adjustments (b) 40 93 Premium on debt exchange (a) (5,293) (3,619) Total debt 58,146 63,327 Current portion of long-term debt (8,072) (3,749) Long-term debt $ 50,074 $ 59,578 (a) In March 2021 and June 2020, we exchanged a portion of\n\nour existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities.

We recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018 and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.
