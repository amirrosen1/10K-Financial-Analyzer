Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and\n\nsupport. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 63,364 $ 53,915 $ 46,398 Intelligent Cloud 75,251 60,080 48,366 More Personal Computing 59,655 54,093 48,251 Total $ 198,270 $ 168,088 $ 143,015 Operating Income Productivity and Business Processes $ 29,687 $ 24,351 $ 18,724 Intelligent Cloud 32,721 26,126 18,324 More Personal Computing 20,975 19,439 15,911 Total $ 83,383 $ 69,916 $ 52,959 No sales\n\nto an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2022, 2021, or 2020. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers were located, was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 United States (a) $ 100,218 $ 83,953 $ 73,160 Other countries 98,052 84,135 69,855 Total $ 198,270 $ 168,088 $ 143,015 (a) Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue. 94 PART\n\nII Item 8 Revenue, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as follows: ( In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Server products and cloud services $ 67,321 $ 52,589 $ 41,379 Office products and cloud services 44,862 39,872 35,316 Windows 24,761 22,488 21,510 Gaming 16,230 15,370 11,575 LinkedIn 13,816 10,289 8,077 Search and news advertising 11,591 9,267 8,524 Enterprise Services 7,407 6,943 6,409 Devices 6,991 6,791 6,457 Other 5,291 4,479 3,768 Total $ 198,270 $ 168,088 $ 143,015 We have recast certain previously reported amounts in the table above to conform to the way we internally\n\nmanage and monitor our business. Our Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue, which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was $91.2 billion, $69.1 billion and $51.7 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These amounts are primarily included in Server products and cloud services, Office products and cloud services, and LinkedIn in the table above. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each\n\nare not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in\n\nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily\n\ndue to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71%, 82%, and 86% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court\n\ndecision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an\n\nagreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. 83 PART II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30,\n\nsupport.
