HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work, where they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our\n\nglobal employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As of June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 122,000 in the U.S. and 99,000 internationally. Of the total employed people, 85,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 73,000 were in product research and development; 47,000 were in sales and marketing; and 16,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our Culture Microsoft’s culture is grounded in the growth mindset.\n\nThis means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. We believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious – trying new things without fear of failure. We identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish: • Obsessing over what matters to our customers. • Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do. • Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses. • Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us. Our employee listening systems enable\n\nus to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Seventy percent of employees globally participated in our fiscal year 2022 Employee Signals survey, which covers a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and development. Throughout the fiscal year, we collect over 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During fiscal year 2022, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing racial injustice, the war in Ukraine, and their general wellbeing. In addition to Employee Signals and Daily\n\nPulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership, performance and development, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support. 8 PART I Item 1 Diversity and Inclusion At Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact economies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit\n\nculture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellness and Safety Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being and safety while they are at work and in their personal lives. We took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now supporting employees in shifting to return to office and/or hybrid arrangements. We developed hybrid guidelines for managers and employees to support the transition and continue to identify ways we can support hybrid work scenarios through our\n\nemployee listening systems. 9 PART I Item 1 We have invested significantly in holistic wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working. We continue to strive to support our Ukrainian employees and their dependents during the Ukraine crisis with emergency relocation assistance, emergency leave, and other benefits.\n\nLearning and Development Our growth mindset culture begins with valuing learning over knowing – seeking out new ideas, driving innovation, embracing challenges, learning from failure, and improving over time. To support this culture, we offer a wide range of learning and development opportunities. We believe learning can be more than formal instruction, and our learning philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the right way. Opportunities include: • Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on both our internal learning portal Learning (Viva Learning + LinkedIn Learning) and our external learning portal MS\n\nLearn are available to all employees worldwide. • In-the-classroom learning, learning cohorts, our early-in-career Aspire program, and manager excellence communities. • Required learning for all employees and managers on topics such as compliance, regulation, company culture, leadership, and management. This includes the annual Standards of Business Conduct training. • On-the-job “stretch” and advancement opportunities. • Managers holding conversations about employees’ career and development plans, coaching on career opportunities, and programs like mentoring and sponsorship. • Customized manager learning to build people manager capabilities and similar learning solutions to build leadership skills for all employees including differentiated leadership development programs. •\n\nNew employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, and culture, as well as ongoing onboarding programs. • New tools to assist managers and employees in learning how to operate, be productive, and connect in the new flexible hybrid world of work. These include quick guides for teams to use, such as Creating Team Agreements, Reconnecting as a Team, and Running Effective Hybrid Meetings. Our employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as thousands of informal and on-the-job learning opportunities. In terms of formal on-line learning solutions, in fiscal year\n\nPulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership, performance and development, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support. 8 PART I Item 1 Diversity and Inclusion At Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact economies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit\n\naccess to opportunity and achievement. The better we represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower. We strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace and workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance to be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as LGBTQIA+, where employees can\n\ngo for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2021 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including: • Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our business. • Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity). • Disability representation. • Pay equity (see details below). Total Rewards We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and\n\nstrategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. As part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, in fiscal year 2021 we expanded stock eligibility to all Microsoft employees as part of\n\nour annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and equivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. In response to the Great Reshuffle, in fiscal year 2022 we announced a sizable investment in annual merit and annual stock award opportunity for all employees below senior executive levels. We also invested in base salary adjustments for our datacenter and retail hourly employees and hourly equivalents outside the U.S. These investments have supported retention and help to ensure that Microsoft remains an employer of choice. Pay Equity In our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report,\n\nmargins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions,\n\njoint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. for $68.7 billion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our\n\nbusiness strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling\n\nnew ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit\n\nfrom those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may\n\nchain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations. • Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies. • Hire and deploy people where we most need them. • Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution functions. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental\n\nregulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results\n\nof operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or\n\neconomic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is\n\nbased on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors PART I Item 1A ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower\n\nproduct lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A\n\nwell-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including\n\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2022 that remain unresolved.

Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries\n\nof what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. 40 PART II Item 7 Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite\n\nof cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive\n\ncompensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our international operations provide a\n\nsignificant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and\n\nyears 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for $28.0 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2022, $40.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends During fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.62 per share. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in\n\nthe form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 51 PART II Item 7 Other Planned Uses of Capital On January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023,\n\nsubject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience\n\nCenters, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses.\n\nCritical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service\n\nthird quarter of fiscal year 2021. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: Percentage (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2022 2021 Change Net\n\nincome $ 72,738 $ 61,271 19% Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties (3,291) 0 * Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes 0 (620) * Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 69,447 $ 60,651 15% Diluted earnings per share $ 9.65 $ 8.05 20% Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties (0.44) 0 * Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes 0 (0.08) * Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 9.21 $ 7.97 16% * Not meaningful. 48 PART II Item\n\n7 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $104.8 billion and $130.3 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Equity investments were $6.9\n\nbillion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that\n\nthe short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound,\n\nCanadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.
