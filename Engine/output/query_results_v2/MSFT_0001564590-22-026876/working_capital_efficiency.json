Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset- backed securities, corporate notes and bonds,\n\nand municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts. 67 PART II Item 8 • Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable\n\ninputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead\n\nrelated to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the\n\nasset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to four years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property\n\nand equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $59,660 and $51,351 74,398 59,715 Operating lease right-of-use assets 13,148 11,088 Equity investments 6,891 5,984 Goodwill 67,524 49,711 Intangible assets, net 11,298 7,800 Other long-term assets 21,897 15,075 Total assets $ 364,840 $ 333,779 Liabilities and stockholders’ equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 19,000 $ 15,163 Current portion of long-term debt 2,749 8,072 Accrued compensation 10,661 10,057 Short-term income taxes 4,067 2,174 Short-term unearned revenue 45,538 41,525 Other current liabilities 13,067 11,666 Total current liabilities 95,082 88,657 Long-term debt 47,032 50,074 Long-term income taxes 26,069 27,190 Long-term unearned revenue 2,870 2,616 Deferred income\n\ntaxes 230 198 Operating lease liabilities 11,489 9,629 Other long-term liabilities 15,526 13,427 Total liabilities 198,298 191,791 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders’ equity: Common stock and paid-in capital – shares authorized 24,000; outstanding 7,464 and 7,519 86,939 83,111 Retained earnings 84,281 57,055 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (4,678) 1,822 Total stockholders’ equity 166,542 141,988 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 364,840 $ 333,779 Refer to accompanying notes. 59 PART II Item 8 CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Operations Net income $ 72,738 $ 61,271 $ 44,281 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash\n\nfrom operations: Depreciation, amortization, and other 14,460 11,686 12,796 Stock-based compensation expense 7,502 6,118 5,289 Net recognized gains on investments and derivatives (409) (1,249) (219) Deferred income taxes (5,702) (150) 11 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (6,834) (6,481) (2,577) Inventories (1,123) (737) 168 Other current assets (709) (932) (2,330) Other long-term assets (2,805) (3,459) (1,037) Accounts payable 2,943 2,798 3,018 Unearned revenue 5,109 4,633 2,212 Income taxes 696 (2,309) (3,631) Other current liabilities 2,344 4,149 1,346 Other long-term liabilities 825 1,402 1,348 Net cash from operations 89,035 76,740 60,675 Financing Cash premium on debt exchange 0 (1,754)\n\n(3,417) Repayments of debt (9,023) (3,750) (5,518) Common stock issued 1,841 1,693 1,343 Common stock repurchased (32,696) (27,385) (22,968) Common stock cash dividends paid (18,135) (16,521) (15,137) Other, net (863) (769) (334) Net cash used in financing (58,876) (48,486) (46,031) Investing Additions to property and equipment (23,886) (20,622) (15,441) Acquisition of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets (22,038) (8,909) (2,521) Purchases of investments (26,456) (62,924) (77,190) Maturities of investments 16,451 51,792 66,449 Sales of investments 28,443 14,008 17,721 Other, net (2,825) (922) (1,241) Net cash used in investing (30,311) (27,577) (12,223) Effect of foreign\n\nexchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (141) (29) (201) Net change in cash and cash equivalents (293) 648 2,220 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 14,224 13,576 11,356 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 13,931 $ 14,224 $ 13,576 Refer to accompanying notes. 60 PART II Item 8 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY STATEMENTS (In millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Common stock and paid-in capital Balance, beginning of period $ 83,111 $ 80,552 $ 78,520 Common stock issued 1,841 1,963 1,343 Common stock repurchased (5,688) (5,539) (4,599) Stock-based compensation expense 7,502 6,118"
