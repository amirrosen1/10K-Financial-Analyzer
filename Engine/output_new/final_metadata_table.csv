In the United States, sales are primarily made through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to pharmacies and patients. The three major wholesale distributors in the United States are McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen Corporation.

In 2016, the significant products for AbbVie were HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, VIEKIRA, Lupron, Synagis","AbbVie's customer base is not broadly diversified, as three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's sales in the United States in 2016, with no individual wholesaler accounting for more than 41% of AbbVie's gross revenues in the United States.

For example, HUMIRA competes with anti-TNF products and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states. AbbVie's virology products compete with other available hepatitis C treatment options.

The complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to greater regulatory scrutiny and more rigorous requirements for approval of follow-on biosimilar products than for small molecule generic pharmaceutical products.

These risks are significant compared to industry standards, as they could lead to material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to the company.","The notable regulatory challenges ELI LILLY & Co faced in 2025 include increased scrutiny and enforcement by government agencies, particularly the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), due to evolving regulatory priorities. This increased scrutiny can result in varying interpretations of laws and regulations, delays, inconsistencies, lapses, or failures, which may adversely affect the company's business and reputation.

The document focuses on the company's internal control over financial reporting, and no changes in leadership or management are reported.","Yes, ELI LILLY & Co reported supply chain disruptions in their 10-K filing for 2025. The disruptions are primarily due to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, leading to tariffs and trade restrictions. These tensions could potentially escalate, causing further disruptions to their operations in or related to China. Additionally, manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at their facilities or those of their contractors and suppliers, the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities in a timely manner or at all, or increases in demand on a supplier with constrained capacity have also led to disruptions in the manufacturing,","The key Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives or sustainability practices discussed in ELI LILLY & Co’s 10-K filing for 2025 include their commitment to research and development, their focus on creating a safe, supportive, ethical, and rewarding work environment, and their dedication to fairness and nondiscrimination in employment practices.
